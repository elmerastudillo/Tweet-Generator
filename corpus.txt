Yeah.  You just lost your father, Barry.  You don't have to be okay.  Actually, I feel closer to my parents  than I ever have.  Well, good, son.   To your pops.  To Henry.  To my Dad.  bottles clink  Where's Iris?  That ain't funny.  I'm gonna chalk that up to grief.  I'll see you both in the morning.  What was that about?  Are you kidding me?  You know Iris isn't here.  What?  They don't talk, Barry.  You know that.  intense musical buildup    Oh, God. What did I do?    Clariss.  louder Clariss!  gasps Oh!  Who's there?  It's time to wake up.  highpitched scratching  dramatic musical buildup    scratching continues        
"The Flash"  We just beat Zoom.  Why does it feel like I just lost?  I feel more broken than I've ever felt.  Wherever you need to go,  whatever you need to do, do it.  I'll be here.  whooshing  grunts  You're safe.  So what should we call this brave new world?  I was thinking Flashpoint.  My name is Edward Clariss.  Rivals should know each other's names.  gunshot  It's like I'll be thinking of a moment from my past and it vanishes.  This isn't your home, Barry.  It's a mirage.  Things are back to how they should be.  Well, for me, anyway. For you?  I guess you'll just have to wait and find out.  Where's Iris?  You know Iris isn't here. They don't talk, Barry.  Oh, God. What did I do?  I made a big mistake. I just couldn't  take it anymore, you know?  What happened with Zoom, my dad dying,  my mother's death, me becoming The Flash.  All of it. I wanted a new life.  I wanted to start over. And that's what I did.  But somehow I I made things worse.  dramatic music  whooshing   No.  So I reset everything.  I put everything back to the way that it was before.  Except some things weren't the same anymore.   Not even a little bit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down.   Take a breath.  inhales, exhales deeply  You were talking way too fast.   Yeah.  What happened?  I really screwed up, Felicity.  And this time I don't know if I can fix it.  Okay, let me get this straight.   You ran back in time?  Yeah.  Stopped ReverseFlash from killing your mom  and then lived in an alternate reality  where both your parents were alive?   Yeah.  And then you  restored the timeline, came back  to the moment you left, and noticed   that things were different?  Exactly.  Does that just happen when you travel through time?  Do things just change like that?  No, I mean, not like this.  Not on I don't know. I don't know Felicity.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.  Okay, why don't you just run me through  walk me through what happened?  And we'll, uh, we'll try and figure it out.  So what changed?  motorcycle engine roars, tires screech  I knew once I got back last night  some things had changed, but before  I could figure out exactly how much,  I had to deal with someone this morning.  whooshing, metal clanking  You are not gonna get too far  on that thing anymore, are you?  I will be taking these back to the jewelry store   you stole them from.  siren wailing  But, uh, you can keep these if you'd like.  bullets clinking  Good luck with that. clicks tongue  whooshing  After he was taken care of, I went to S.T.A.R. Labs,  and that's when I found out  a lot more had changed than I realized.  What kind of idiot still thinks  I can't outrun bullets?  That guy should be the criminal poster boy  for what not to do against The Flash.  So what are we gonna call him?   You mean like a nickname?  Yeah.  Cisco does it for all of them, he's like the master of it.  Can't just call him Suspect on a Motorcycle,  Right? What do you think?   I don't know.  I'll take this one.  Uh, The Crook. Lame?   A FiveFinger  How about Thief?  He robs stuff. Let's just call him Thief.  Gotta get to the gym. Excuse me.  The gym? Is he is he, like, working out now or  You know, Barry, sometimes your jokes  just aren't very funny.  I should I should get back to the paper.  It's okay. I was just leaving.  Hey, guys Hey, Joe. Look, hey, I'm sorry.  Look, I just, I know you guys aren't speaking  to each other right now, but I was just thinking  maybe we could talk about why that is for a minute.  I No.   Dude.  No, we can't.  Okay, I'm sorry. I just look.  I'm sorry, I just thought, I don't know,  maybe it would be good for you guys just to  hear it said out loud. This is because  of what he did, Barry, not me.   Iris.  What?  What could you possibly have to say?  somber music  I'll just see you at the station, all right?  Nice job with, uh, Thief.   Uh, give me a lift to CCU?  Sure.  So you're still taking engineering classes.   Yeah.  Yeah, cool.  All right, well, good good luck with that.   What is wrong with you?  Nothing.  Are you trying to make me as mad at you as I am at him?  No, no, look, I'm I'm sorry, I  I guess I don't fully understand why you're so upset at him.  sighs  Then maybe you shouldn't bring it up again.  Yeah.  How about we talk about us instead?  Us? You you mean you and me,  like, trying this?  I just thought with everything  that's happened lately and everything  that you've been through,  I wanted to make sure that you still felt the same.  Well, Iris, I did what you said.  I went where I needed to go,  I did what I needed to do,  and I'm ready.  I never told you to do that.  Yeah, no, you did on the porch,  right after we beat Zoom, right before you   Wow, you kissed Iris.  Well, not anymore.  I've kissed Iris West twice, and I have managed  to erase both times from existence.  Man, I hate it when that happens.  That's just the least of my problems today.  Joe, hey hey, man, um, can we talk for a second?  Yeah, I just gotta drop this off for Singh.  Oh, Captain Singh's back? That's just terrific.  Yeah, why, did he go somewhere?  Uh, no maybe. I don't know, I  Is that cowl cutting off all the oxygen in your brain?  What? No, I'm fine. Why? Why?  Because you've been acting real odd lately.  Asking why Iris wasn't at the house last night.  And that stunt you pulled at S.T.A.R. Labs this morning.  You know damn well why she's not talking to me.  Of course. Uh, because sh  Because I should have told her her mother was alive  but I didn't.  Yeah, but she forgave you for that.  Ah one would think that she would have.  I don't know if she ever will or not,  but you sticking your nose into it isn't helping, Bar.   Good intentions and all.  I was okay.  We found another husk this morning.  Husk?  Singh wants this processed ASAP.  Yes, the skin husks we've been finding around  the city are the ones we think are attached to the metahumans.  This is now the fourth one.  Well, let's figure out what's happening  before there's a fifth.  Yes, sir.  stammers  Deep breaths.  Um, hello?  Yes. Hello, Mr. Allen.  I can still see you're there and no,  I don't want your help, thank you.  What are you doing here, Julian Albert,  metahuman CSI Specialist?  I did tell you the metahuman conference   was only for two days.  Okay, but this is  Still our lab unfortunately.  Yes, County forgot to mention that significant detail  before assigning me, but here we are.  Looks like you and I get to be roomies  for a little longer than we'd hoped.  Roomies.  There's a whole new guy at work   that you didn't even know about?  Yeah.  And he's worked there for almost a year.  And he doesn't like me very much, apparently.  Well, that's impossible. Everybody likes Barry Allen.  You're like pudding. Everybody likes pudding.  Not everyone.   I hated that we never spoke.  I think the thing that haunts me the most is the fact  that I never told him I loved him.  Or that I idolized him.  I have memories of Dante all the time.  But they don't feel like gifts.  They feel like reminders  of what I did wrong,  and how I'll never make another memory with Dante again.  Excuse me.  What are you doing here?  Oh, wait a second. Now you wanna be there for me?  I'm just trying to understand.  My brother's dead.  There's nothing to understand.  Exit's that way.  So you altered the timeline,  Joe and Iris don't talk anymore,  there's a guy at work a new guy  who doesn't like you, you never kissed Iris,  and Cisco's brother is dead.  Admittedly, that is an issue.  And what if there's more?  Well, has anything here changed?  sighs No, I don't know. I mean,  everything seems the same, I think.  Good.   Can I use hold on.  Uh  I'll be real careful.  I got it, don't worry. I got it.  keyboard clacking rapidly  Yeah, I don't know I mean, everything looks okay.  Wait.  Who's that young boy with Dig?  No way. He didn't have kid before?  No, he had a kid. He has he has a kid.  Yeah, it was baby Sara.  Baby John.  No. Are you  Oh, my God. It really can affect us.  Okay, you know what? I don't wanna know anymore.  Okay, I know this is a lot of pressure,  but everything's gonna be all right.   I screwed up everyone's life.  Yeah, well, maybe   you should tell them.  I'm not gonna tell them.  I mean, how is that gonna help? That's just  gonna make everything worse. I mean I don't know   how to fix this.  Okay, well,  you're gonna figure it out. If there's one thing  I've learned from you,  is that with you, anything is possible.  Why? 'Cause I'm The Flash?  No. Because you are Barry Allen.  And sweet, loving, kind Barry Allen  that everybody likes,  the Barry Allen who's just like pudding,  can fix this.  So go and fix this.  Yeah.  Okay, you're right. Yeah.   Now!  Right now?   Yes!  Okay, all right.  dramatic music  deep whooshing  Stop!  Find me.  Who? Who?  scraping on glass  monastic chanting  I am Alchemy.  I have visions  of another life.  Please, make them stop.  Is that what you really want?  To make the visions stop?  Or do you want them to come true?  To be fast again?   To have speed?  Yes.  Do you want that other life?  That's what I want.  Once again, you will have power.  And no man will be your rival.  chuckles  Julian, I thought you could use some help on this one.  You know, the two heads thing and all.  I don't need any help, Detective.  Especially from him.   What is that?  Another epidermal husk, Allen.  A fully intact human pelt,  comprised of nothing but the stratum corneum.  You see what I mean?  Do we have any theories as to what's causing them?  Well, I'll take a wild guess at it and say  it's the same thing that created the last four husks.  Spalling could be caused from toxic epidermal necrolysis,  or maybe some kind of moist desquamation  from intense radiation exposure.   We've had a lot of  Radioactive metas.  Yes, thank you, Allen. I've read all the case studies.  I'll tell you what, when I figure it out,  I'll enlighten you then, shall I?  Thanks.  How have I worked with this guy for the past year?  Yeah, you say that all the time.  I'm sure I do.  Julian?  Are you certain that Barry can't  take a sample or something to speed things along?  sighs I'm sure, Detective.  Quite sure.  whooshes  You might wanna get that to S.T.A.R. Labs.  Yeah.  You know, there's really not that much here.  Yeah, no, I know. It's basically touch DNA.  I had to steal the sample because our metahuman expert   wouldn't let me take one.  Oh, you mean Julian Albert?  sighs Yeah, you know him?  Yeah, we've known him for a while.  He's the best.   Um, you need me?  No, I think I got this.   But thank you.  Okay.  Cisco told me you showed up  to his bereavement group last night.  Yeah, I did.  He also tell you it didn't go so well?  It's only been a few months since Dante  was killed by that drunk driver.  I'm sure he just needs a little bit more time.  Wait, why is he so mad at me?  Oh, no. I'm staying out of that.  Cait, he'll he'll barely look at me  unless other people are in the room.  Maybe it's just easier when the rest of us are around.  sighs  Do you think maybe you could convince him  to come with you to my house for dinner tonight?   Why?  So I can try to fix things  between us, maybe between Joe and Iris, too.  Just all of us together again in one room  and try to work this out once and for all.  Think you can do that?  Okay.  But how are you gonna get Joe and Iris there?  Joe? Hey, Joe.  Um, so I talked to Iris and she just has  a few things that she wants to say to you.  Bar, I thought I told you to stay out of this.  Oh, no, no, no. This was all her, I swear.  So she just, out of the blue,  decided now she wants to talk to me?   claps hands softly  whooshing  Hey, um, so Joe said that he'd give you  what you need about the husks for a story.   Hi.  Hi.  Uh, what? He just decided, out of the blue, to tell me?  No one at the precinct will say anything.  Even Julian. Oh, I hate that guy.  Yeah, you always say that.  Um, when does he want to do it?  Uh, tonight, at the house.  He said he's making your favorite.  Okay, he's out of his mind.  He knows I will not go back there,  even if he does make one of Grandma Esther's recipes, so   whooshing, papers falling  When?  Uh, tonight. Tonight, yeah.   Um, at the house.  At the house?   Yeah.  She vowed she'd never   set foot in the house again.  Unless you made dinner.   chuckles Dinner?  Yeah, like old times.  So, one of her favorites,  like Grandma Esther's recipes, maybe.  Okay. I suppose I can make something.   Which dish?  whooshing  He said he'd make the chicken.  I hate the chicken. I like the noodles.   Oh, noodles, okay.  Why are you out of breath?  I'm not out of breath. Uh, Joe also thought  maybe just to take some pressure off that he'd invite  Caitlin and Cisco.   Okay, um, what time?  Uh, 7:00.   All right.  whooshing  Um, 7:00 will work, by the way.   Okay, but which dish?  I mean, I was thinking  maybe to take some pressure off, you could invite   Caitlin and Cisco.  That's a good idea,  'cause if we're gonna do this, I gotta get started.  Yeah, I got it. No problem, yeah.   Bar?  Yeah?   Which dish?  Noodle dish.  Yeah, noodle dish.  whimsical music  This hits the spot, huh?  You can thank Grandma Esther.  No, I mean, it's good. I just meant, um  all of us, actually, just here, together.  I was actually thinking, um, that maybe it'd be fun  if we all went away together for a few days.  Just like a little Team Flash vacay.   And do what?  Bond. gulps   Reconnect.  You mean like a retreat?   Nah.  With trust exercises?  Epic fail, party of six.  I just I just feel like we're not the team  that we were or can be.  sighs  No one?  I'd be down for it.  Okay.  So other than Wally,  I'm the only one that thinks that's a good idea?  I don't think The Flash really takes vacations.  Especially with all these husks showing up all over town.  Speaking of husks, I'm glad you're finally ready  to open up about them.  Iris, I already told you, I can't tell you  anything about this case.  Oh, really?  Because that's not what I was told.  Strange. I was under the impression  you had some things to say to me, too.  Isn't that right, Bar?  Told you. Epic fail.  Okay, look, yeah. I arranged this.  I put all this together. I'm sorry, guys.  Look, I just we're not acting like a team,  and I just wanted things back to how they were.   Just fixed.  If you wanted things fixed,  maybe you should have gone back in time  and stopped my brother from dying.  somber music  You want me to change the timeline to save Dante?  Why would you do that? It's not like he's your brother.  cell phones beep, vibrate  Metahuman app. We gotta go.  dramatic music  sighs  whooshing  whooshing  Remember me, Flash?  Clariss?  Clariss?  dramatic music  Oh, you do remember, Flash?  Good, yeah.  Because I remember everything, too.   How are you here?  It doesn't matter.  You see, what does matter  is that I know your little secret.  You changed the timeline.  Because if I recall correctly,  the only Speedsters in my other life  were me and that smartass Kid Flash,  until you showed up and stole everything from me!  I didn't steal anything from you, Clariss.  I I was just trying to put things back  to the way they're supposed to be.  This is how my life is supposed to be!  For years, I felt like something was missing.  And now I know why.  Well, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do this to you.  Yeah, well, you did.  And here I am.  Your Rival, back again.  Believe me, Flash, this time,  you're not gonna steal my life so easily.  whooshing  thud  grunting  whooshing  whooshing  We finally get rid of Zoom,  and there's another evil Speedster?  Who is this guy, now?  I can help you with that.  I finally got the results back  from the test I ran on the husk  that Barry gave me this morning.  And it's weird, because there's  no traces of dark matter,  but there are traces of the Speed Force.  And that's the husk from this Speedster?  Appears so. His name is  Edward Clariss.  And somehow Barry is exactly right.  Can I talk to you for a second?  Yeah.  sighs  pensive music  S.T.A.R. Labs isn't the only one  with access to the city's security cams.  It's pretty obvious that this guy knows you.  You want to tell me what that's about?  This is why you've been acting so weird lately  trying to get me and my dad talking again,  tricking all of us into dinner tonight  because you're keeping something from us.  You need to tell me what is going on, Barry.  Right now.  And if you lie to me  this thing between us, it cannot happen.  You're right, and, uh, I'm sorry, I  I did this. All of this.  It's my fault and I've been trying to fix it.  But I think that there's only one way to do that now.  I'm sorry, Iris.  whooshing  thrilling music  grunts, panting  Flash?  Flash.  Here, put these on.  We need to talk.  Call you up in the middle of the night   Like a firefly without a light   Where are we?  Motorcar Diner in Central City.  Yeah, I meant what year?   Runaway train never going back   Care to get something to eat?  'Cause I'm starved. The corn beef hash here   is the best I've ever had.  This is why you pulled me  out of the Speed Force?   Buy me a meal?  Because you were  about to reset the timeline again  after screwing it all up.  Oh, yeah, I know about that.   How did you  After your  notsosubtle reaction when you first met me  Harry told me all that happened with Zoom and your mom  and your dad, so I decided  I'd keep my eye on you for a bit.   He tell you anything else?  He did.  I'm your father's doppelganger.  Sorry about that.  It's just really weird.  And really sad, too I'm sure.  Having a loss like that in your life,  I see why you'd wanna erase it.  Who wouldn't try to save their parents?
  I understand that, Barry, completely.  But the thing is, there are consequences  to time travel.  I have heard all of this before.  Not from me you haven't.  I'm not some Doctor with a theory, Barry.  I'm a Speedster, like you, who's travelled in time,  and made these same mistakes you are making right now.  Here, let me show you something.   Okay, you know what?  Humor me, kid.   This coffee cup right here.  All right, yeah.  Think of it as the spacetime continuum.  Whenever you go back in time it breaks.  vibrates rapidly and shatters   For real? I mean  Now  you can reset the timeline, you can try to fix it,  but no matter how hard you try  it's never gonna be exactly how it was.  Look, I've learned all this stuff  that I didn't know before, okay?   I'm not gonna make the same  Mistakes.  Yeah, what you just said right there?  That is the paradox of time travel,  and also the paradox of life.  I mean, if I only knew then what I know now.  Why have these powers if I can't go back  and fix what I broke?  We're not gods, we're men,  who, for whatever reason, have been given  extraordinary abilities.  The question you need to ask yourself is,  what kind of hero are you gonna be?  Are you just gonna take a doover  every time you make a mistake?  Or will you live with them and move forward?  Where's Barry?  whooshing  I need to tell you all something.  The truth.  The truth about what?  sighs Okay, um  after Zoom killed my dad,  after we defeated him, um  I wasn't in a great space,  and I felt like the only way I could fix that was  to run back in time and save my mom.  You stopped the ReverseFlash from killing your mom?  Yeah.  Wait, so, is she alive?  She was. For a few months.  I lived with her and my dad.  I had a completely different life.  I wasn't even The Flash for most of it.  I don't understand.  You created a whole other existence.  How is that possible?  sighs  Okay, um  I'll do the this is the timeline.  This is the point that we exist on it right now.  This past point is where my mom was murdered.  So when I saved her, I created a new reality.  A new timeline.   I was living in  A mirror universe.  It's called a Flashpoint, apparently.  But you decided to leave it. Why?  That life started to spin out of control.  This guy, Clariss,  he was a Speedster there, too.  He was known as the Rival.  He caused a lot of problems.  So, um  I decided to run back in time again and let things happen  as they were supposed to, in hopes of  resetting the timeline, but   But what?  But, um,  when I came back, things weren't the same.  You mean people. Like us.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I created another timeline.  Uh, it's the one we're living in now.  It's not as different as the last one.  Not in large ways, but in some ways,  in smaller ways, and, uh, meaningful ways  for all of you or anybody that's close to me.  And I can't ever really put it back together.  Barry, that's a lot to take in.  Yeah, it is.  We got along in that other life,  my dad and I, didn't we?  That's why you've been working so hard  to get us talking again.  Okay, here's the thing. Um, I will tell you  what's different, all of you, if you wanna know.  But you have to live with those differences  because I can't change it again.  But at least you'll know.  And you all deserve that choice.  So you decided it was okay to change things  when someone in your family dies,  but when it's someone in my family  I'm gonna go talk to him.  Hey.  What are you working on?  These are the gauntlets for my suit.  And you probably know nothing about that.   Do you?  I'm really trying here, Cisco.  Barry, I'm the one who's been trying.  I've been trying this whole time  to get you to do this one thing for me,  but you kept saying, "No, Cisco.  I can't, Cisco. I would never do that, Cisco."  And now you're telling me you went and did it   for yourself.  Were you listening?  It it went bad. It went really bad.  I don't care!  At least I'd have my brother back.  Yeah, you would have him back,  but because of it, somebody might have something  happen to them that's just as awful  as what happened to Dante, and trust me,  you don't want that on your conscience.  It's a heavy burden to bear.  And I don't know how many times I've said this, but  I'm really sorry about Dante, man.  Sorry doesn't change anything.  No, it doesn't, but I can't go back.  I can't change it.  All I can do is move forward.  I really hope you can, too.  Hey, um, I need your help.  It's the four words I seem to hear you  most often say, Barry.  That and, "I hate that guy."  Which, the feeling's mutual, so  Mmhmm. Okay, um,  this is gonna be hard for you,  but I just, for a second,  need you to imagine that we're actually friends.  Can't do it.   Friendly.  Equally as challenging, Barry.   Hmm.  But I'll give it a whirl.  What are you after? I need to read your report   on one of the husks.  Which one?  The one from this morning. Edward Clariss.   Edward Clariss?  Yeah.   Why?  May help me figure out  a case I'm working on.  Well, the nutshell is, uh,  the hyaluronic acids were found to be above normal.  Uh, androgen degradation atypically low.   Mmhmm.  Cellular regeneration  seemed to occur at a staggering rate.   Mmhmm.  It's quite a bit different  from the previous husks that we found.  That's about it. Could I  could I maybe just take a peek at it?  I'm sorry, it's just something I need to see   to know what I'm looking for.  scoffs   Sure.  Great, thank you.  Wait, why does this say the body's place of discovery  was Williamson when it was found on the waterfront in Leawood?  The body ended up in Leawood.  There was a strong current this morning,  so chances are that it originated from Williamson.  Somewhere near the old Prescott sawmill.   You done?  Yeah, uh, yes.  Thank you.  whooshing  You found me again, Flash.  I wondered how long it'd take you this time   to figure it out.  Wasn't too hard.  I see you didn't bring your little sidekick   with you, though.  Nope.   Just me.  That's too bad.  I brought one.   beam blasting  grunts  dramatic music  Oh, and Flash? A little, uh,  quaking in your boots wouldn't be inappropriate.   So?  He changed our lives, Iris.  And he kept that secret from us.  You really just want us to just be okay with that?  All I'm saying, Wally, is that he made a mistake.   Yeah, he did.  Cisco, we all make mistakes  to protect the people that we love.  I mean, you told Captain Cold that Barry was The Flash  in order to protect your brother.  Okay. Not my finest moment.  That's my point. It was one decision  made in one moment.  One very heartwrenching moment.  Look, guys, we're like a family here, okay?  And sometimes families get mad at each other  for screwing up.  I know that all too well.  But they also forgive.  Because after a while, it just seems silly  when you stop and think about it.  sentimental music  chuckles  Guys, Iris is right.  We all have secrets.  We've all screwed up, but this is Barry  we're talking about.  computer beeping  Who apparently is in trouble.  dramatic music   beam blasting  grunting  And who are you?  I am Alchemy.  Okay, well, what do you want?  To help people achieve their true potential  such as he has.  And why are you doing this?  Because I'm preparing this world.   whooshing  grunting  Remember what happened here last time, Flash?  It's where I died.  grunting  And I'm not gonna waste this second chance I've been given.  This time, I'm gonna show you who's the fastest man alive.   grunts  metal clangs   computer beeping rapidly  Barry? Barry!  His coms aren't working.  He's at the Prescott Mill.  That's right around the corner.  We gotta do something.  whooshing  grunting  Having fun yet, Flash?  'Cause I'm having a blast.  grunting  Ah!  grunting  Ah!  whooshing  Time to look for a new rival.  laser beam blasts  Stay away from my friend.  whooshing  both grunting  glasses beep  Thank you.  Sorry it took so long.  You were just in time.  Nothing. No mention of Alchemy anywhere.  No maskwearing monk metas.   Not even close.  I didn't find  any known aliases in any of the records at CCPD.  And Clariss won't say anything either.  All right, well, keep at him. Alchemy is the one that gave   Clariss back his speed.  He's kinda like a doctor,  that way, don't you think?  Come on, don't pretend like "Doctor Alchemy"  doesn't have a nice ring to it.  Okay, well, that explains why he didn't have  any traces of dark matter in his cells.  He didn't get his powers from the particle accelerator,  he got them from Alchemy.  What was that?  Doctor Alchemy.  laughs How could he do that?  I don't know, but we need to figure it out.  There's gonna be more.  Alchemy Doctor Alchemy said that he is  preparing this world.   Preparing the world?  Mmhmm.  For what? Like, the second coming or something?  I think that everyone that had powers in Flashpoint  is gonna get them back.  Well, we already found four other husks,  which means there's at least that many  running around Central City right now.  We need to find him before he changes  more people's lives.  Speaking of changing lives,  we all talked about it, Barry, and we don't want to know  what our lives were like in Flashpoint.  You sure?  To quote the wise words of Harry,  "What's the point, Allen?"  I gotta get to the precinct.  Uh, stop by Jitters on the way?  Yeah, it's on me.  Oh, good. Then I'm coming, too.  sentimental music  Yo, um, I've just been thinking that it was pretty cool  having someone out there with me last night.  And, I don't know, maybe we could  make that a thing every once in a while.  I I got some things to work on  before I start doing that.  Yeah.  Maybe someday.  It'd be pretty bitchin'.  Glad to see everything's starting to  get back to the way it was.  Yeah. I mean  mostly.  You have nothing to worry about, Cait.  I think out of everyone, actually, you're the only one  that wasn't really affected when I messed with the timeline.  I mean, unless you're secretly moonlighting  as an ophthalmologist.   A what?  Kidding, nothing.  Just a Flashpoint joke. I'll see you later.  suspenseful music  ice crackling   What's that?  That's the finished  Edward Clariss report.  Or should I say The Rival?  At least, that's what The Flash called him  last night when he took him into Iron Heights.   Huh.  I thought you might  want to see it.  You know, to do with your other case.  Actually it turns out there was no connection.  Hm.  You know, I have to ask you.  Hm?   How did you know his name?  What?  Yesterday, you came in and you asked  for Edward Clariss' report, but I didn't tell you  who that husk belonged to, so that means  you stole a sample when you showed up to my crime scene.  How did you do that?   I  laughs Oh, wow.  You've really got this good guy routine thing down, haven't you?  And everyone just buys it.  There is something not right about you, Allen.  They don't see it but I do.   Is that right?  Yes.  chuckles You know why I don't actually like you, don't you?  exhales  I don't trust you.  And I don't like things that I don't trust.  See you tomorrow, roomie.   Hey.  Hey.  Hi.  I was hoping you'd be here.  Yeah. Dad and I just polished off  Grandma Esther's noodle dish.  Oh, did you leave me some?   Too slow, Flash.  Ooh.  both laugh  So you guys are?  We're good.  Are you sure you don't wanna know about the other timeline?  No, I guess, in my mind, wherever you go,  you'll always be Barry,  and I'll always be Iris.  And we always find each other.  sentimental music  ominous music  You failed.  You failed, Clariss.  I'm sorry. Please  let me try again.  Alchemy!   faint electrical crackling  No, no, no, no, no.  rumbling, booming  No! screams
1 Barry: My name is Barry Allen,  and I am the fastest man alive.  To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,  but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,  I fight crime and find other metahumans like me.  In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,  I was accidentally thrust into the future,  and I saw him murder the woman that I love.  But I won't let that happen.  I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future,  and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.  I am The Flash.  Previously on "The Flash"  The Philosopher's Stone has been the key to everything.  So we destroy the Stone, and Savitar is gone for good.  There's only one thing we can do with it.  Throw it into the Speed Force.  I have to do what I can to help.  I'm the guy who avoided his dying mother for weeks.  I have a whole lot to make up for.  I like you, Julian, but I'm also afraid of my powers  and what they could do to anyone who gets close to me.  I didn't ask for these powers,  just like you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.  I think we should be terrified together.  Sure. Together it is.  It's crazy how fast I've gotten in such a short time.  And I'm gonna need you to get a lot faster.  I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar; you are.  growling  Iris West, will you marry me?  gasps  exciting music      grunts    And Wally just beat his personal best.  Oh, Barry's putting him through the wringer today.  Excuse Barry? Excuse me?  Uh, yeah, I suppose it could be Barry,  or it could be his genius coach, whose sole purpose  on this Earth is milking epic greatness  from those around him.  Thank you very much.   It could also be Jesse.  What?  Come on, Wally doesn't want to get beat by his girlfriend.  Also, please, just refrain from  using "milk" as a verb from now on, please.  exciting music  I'm getting kind of dizzy.  You're supposed to get dizzy, Wallace!  You're supposed to get exhausted on this route.  It's supposed to simulate  the stress that you're gonna feel  when you finally confront Savitar,  so my suggestion to you is, suck it up, buttercup!  Milking epic greatness.  Yeah, no kidding.  Why don't you take it down a little, tiger mom?  Barry and Jesse are at the final mark.  Get ready.  Wally's at the home stretch.  Come on    stopwatch beeps  dramatic music   Guys?  0.21 seconds.    0.21.  Just fast enough to save Iris from Savitar.  You did it.  laughs   You did it.  We did it.   You did it!  You did it.  suspenseful music  You okay?  stammers Uh, yeah, yeah.  I'm just happy.  We all are, Wally.  We all are.     Julian. Hi.   Ah, Caitlin, how are you?  How are you? It  You've come straight from the airport?  Uh yes, yes, uh  Barry said he had something to tell me. Is he here?  He'll be here any minute, I'm sure.   Shall we? Yeah?  Yes, we shall.  chuckles We shall.  indistinct conversation   Look who I found.  Hey, guys.  Oh!   How are we doing?  Julian.  It's good to see you. Good to see you all.  Jesse, I thought you were heading back to Earth2.  I actually decided to stick around for a little while.  Hey, does anybody know what's going on?  I mean, I got a mountain of paperwork back at the office.  No, not the foggiest. I was gonna ask you.  Ah. Welcome home, James.  Can I brew you a proper cup of tea?  And a robust pickmeup for you, mate.  No need. We hit Jitters on the way.  Got everybody something. You guys are  I thought you were on deadline.  I am.  You ready?   For you.  Here.  Okay. What is going on with you two?   Uh, do you want to?  Mmmm.  This is all you.   Okay, here goes.  Mmhmm.  Um clears throat  sighs   gasps  No!  Congratulations! That's so exciting!  Thank you. Thanks.   Hey, thanks, man.  Wow.  You did it. This is this is fantastic.  Well done, Joe. Congratulations.  Dad, say something, please.  soft music    My baby girl.  You have grown into a beautiful woman.  You're marrying the best man I know.  Thanks.  You two bring me nothing but joy.   I'm so happy for you.  Okay.  This cuteness right here, I cannot   Congrats.  Thanks, man.   Thank you.  Yeah.  And speaking of, um,  best man  I'll do it. Of course.  When Barry and I first met   H.R.  You mean him.  Okay, good.  I  I'd be honored. Really.  I mean, as long as I can get that plusone.  'Cause, you know, me and Gypsy,  we about to tear up the dance floor for you guys.   laughter  Barry.   Can I talk to you for a second?  Yeah, yeah.  laughter  Now, I wanted to be sure that you heard what I said in there.  I couldn't be happier.  Okay, right.  So  why didn't you ask my permission?  I mean, I told you the story  of me asking Francine's dad's permission,  like, a hundred times.  At least, yeah. And that's a great story.  Eh, but you missed the point?  I yeah, I  I don't it was spontaneous.  I knew you'd say yes, and I wanted to surprise you.  Yo. There's a threealarm fire in the Raab building.  Fire department is evacuating it now.  Jesse is a little preoccupied with the ring,   so it's just you and me.  Okay.   What you two waiting for? Go.  Yeah.  sirens wailing    Wallace  Wallace West.  dramatic music  grunts  Wally    What the hell?  growling  Wally.  Hey.  What's happening? What's wrong?  Where'd he go?   gasps  Who?  Where is he?  Who? Where is who?  Savitar.    I feel fine.  So now Savitar's mindpunking you  chuckles Oh, boy.  This never stops never stopping.  How long has this been going on, Wally?   Like a week.  scoffs A week.  Wally, why didn't you say anything before?  Because I didn't know what this was.  I thought that this was just maybe in my head.  You know, I wasn't looking at it like I was keeping it to myself.  That's exactly what you did, though, Wally.  You did keep it to yourself,  and with Savitar, that's not something we can do.  This is Iris' life we're talking about.   Yes, I know that.  Do you, though, Wally?   Yes.  Uh, okay.  clears throat  Until now, you only saw him, right?  Yeah, this was the first time it was physical.  What he wasn't there!  Okay? You weren't fighting him.  He was messing with your head.   It was all in your mind.  I've been there. Done that.  It's miserable.  Okay, why don't I run a brain scan on Wally,  see if he was similarly affected to when Julian was possessed?  Yeah, that's fine. Why don't we do that?  Wally shouldn't be in here anyway.   What?  Barry, he knows he messed up.  That's not what this is about, okay? Look, it's  if Savitar's using Wally the same way he used Julian,  how do we know he's not spying on us through Wally right now?  Wally, we don't know how this works.  How do we know he can't see and hear everything we're doing?  Look, you're out.   I'm out?  I'm sorry, Wally.  Yeah, you don't sound real sorry.  All right, fellows, let's take a quick ten.  We're all still the "Four Amigos" here, right?  What?  You don't have that movie on this Earth?   I'll go talk to him.  Yeah, talk some sense into him.   All right.  So what now?  Well, we know from the future  that Savitar gets out of wherever he is,  but for now, he's still trapped, so sighs   I need to talk to him again.  No, I knew you were thinking this.  All right? And I won't do it.  I'm not gonna be your personal walkietalkie to him.  Guys, we can't. We don't have the Stone.  Actually, we can.  We still have Savitar's spatial frequency  from when we plugged in Linda Blair here,  so I think we could work without the Stone.  Julian, I'm sorry, man. We don't really have a choice.  Oh, we do have a choice. I have a choice.  And I choose to decline.  I'm sorry.   We're starting to fray.  Well, we can't. All right?  Everybody just needs to trust me.  I know what I'm doing.  door opens and closes  sighs Come to talk me into it, then?  No.  Barry's lost his bloody mind if he thinks  I'm gonna volunteer to be abused again.  He's just trying to protect Iris.  We all are.  But not like that.  Is the reason you don't want to do this because  you don't want me to see it?  sighs I just think  hearing his voice coming out of me, I  it just makes it impossible for you to see me as a normal  Hey.  I've had somebody else's voice coming out of my mouth,  and you were still able to see the real me.  How about trusting that I can do the same thing?  Sorry.  I just wanted to do that,  in case you changed your mind later.  Quite all right.  Julian, you're gonna be okay.  You know the drill.  Just let your mind go blank.  We'll take care of the rest. Okay?  Just let Savitar back in the driver's seat once more.   Brilliant.  Thank you.  Let's just get this over with, yeah?  electricity whirring  breathing deeply  gasps  distorted Bow before my greatness.  Be in awe, as you are in the presence of the Almighty.  Enough with the religious nonsense.  You were just a man. Like me.  I'm nothing like you, Barry.  You're cruel, you're selfish.  From my perspective, you're the big bad.  scoffs Stupid.  Still here, pretender?  Still trying to find your place?  I found my place.  It's standing here with these people,  against you.  You know, the sad thing is that you live.  You survived my wrath.  The coward.   Irony.  Where are you?  You said that I trapped you in the future, where?  The only place that you could think of.  The only place that could hold me.  How long have you been imprisoned?  Long enough to lose my mind several times over.  It's only my will that keeps me on this side of sanity.  You know, it's funny, when I think of sanity,  I don't necessarily think of Savitar.  Well, that's because you're small, Cisco.  You've always been small.  Reverb told you that you could have been a god.  But instead, you'd rather work as tech support.  You want to tell me why we're enemies?  Because we had to be.  Only one of us could live.  You thought that Thawne and Zoom  were your biggest foes, but  but it's me.  It's always been me, Barry.  Man, what did we ever do to you?  You took everything from me!  I never asked for any of this, Joe.  I am only this way because of you.  All of you!  When do we meet?  Not long now.  You're there when I become who I am.  You're saying I caused you to get your speed?   I created you?  Oh, no.  I created myself, Barry.  Only I can bring out my greatness.  Your greatness?  Well, you're still trapped,  wherever you are,  and I don't know how you're gonna escape.  I mean, we got rid of the Philosopher's Stone.  Did we?  I am closer to my freedom  than I have ever been.  Every step, every move that you make,  it only brings me nearer to it.  I only need one more thing.  Man, do you love to hear yourself talk.  Iris, trying to show that you're not afraid?  But I know you are.  I'm sorry that you have to die.  But it's you or me.  And despite your feeble efforts to change the future,  you can't,  because I am the future, Flash.  Barry, you've had to suffer worse than anyone.  You've endured pain your whole life.  Your mother,  your father  Trust me,  you'll never get over this.    gasps  Well  Well?  Good chat, was it?  II don't know if I can take another  one of those sÃ©ances. Anyone else with me?  I almost filled my drawers.  Okay, so other than Savitar taking  scaringthebejeezusoutofus to a whole new level,  did we actually learn anything?   Please say yes.  Maybe.  When I mentioned the Stone, he questioned whether or not  we'd really gotten rid of it.  We did. We threw it into the Speed Force.  That's like throwing it into outer space.  Uh, maybe we didn't. I mean, maybe there's more to it.   A second Stone?  Or maybe the Stone  that we had was part of a larger piece.  How about the Acolytes?  Maybe they know something we don't.   Hey, what about that one guy?  Craig?  Yes, the Acolyte that you dropped in on  when you went all cold?  His car's GPS has him located  somewhere near Mount Buccelato.  Buccelato, that's miles away.  What what would he be doing over there?  There's one way to find out.  exciting music  Talk to us. What do you see?  Some serious "Temple of Doom" stuff.  They have a box.  God of Speed, soon your enemies will fall  and you will rise once more on Earth.  It looks just like the last one that held the Stone.   You were right, Barr.   What are you gonna do?  I'm gonna go see what's in it.    What exactly were you guys doing up here?  Worshipping His Greatness.  Let's see how far he gets without this.  chuckles He's ten steps ahead of you.  There's no stopping Savitar.  If I were you  breathing heavily  I'd move up the wedding. chuckles  dramatic music    So far not so good.  Can't get any readings off of it.  It's the same as the last time.  Are we sure this isn't the same box?  Well, it can't be. I mean, I threw the other one into the Speed Force.  Yeah, but you said the explosion sent you to the future.  What if it did something to the box too, you know?  sighs  I hate to say it, Barry, but,  after all my years of research,  I've never heard or come across another box or Stone;  I think this is it.  If that's true, we need to consider the possibility  that Savitar has that Stone.  I'm gonna check for radioactive isotopes  or gravimetric force residue,  'cause if it's the same as the last time  We're in big trouble.  sighs  You can go faster than that, Wally. Run!  And  time!  Yeah. Yeah. That was, uh  good.  We need to go again.  But I don't understand. I was fast enough this morning.  Now all of a sudden, I'm too slow?  You're in your head. You gotta get out of your head, man.  You gotta just run, you gotta push everything else to the side.  Yeah, I'm trying, H.R. I can't do it!   Okay. Okay.  All right?  All right. Why not?  I don't know.  I do.  You're afraid.  Which is I totally understand.  I mean, if I were in your shoes, I'd be terrified.  But  you can't run from a place of fear, all right?  Nobody can do anything effectively  coming from a place of fear. Trust me, I know.  Savitar can get inside my head.  What am I supposed to do  if he does that at the wrong time?  sighs  It sure would be a lot easier if I just  knew exactly how that night went.  chuckles Would it ever.  Are you picking up what I'm putting down?  Uhhuh.  Let's go.  No way. I'm not gonna vibe you there  for you to watch your sister die.  Okay. Cesco, Cesco, Cesco  ththis is to help Wallace  to help him see what happens  so he knows what to do in the moment.  Come on, Cisco, please.  If Savitar's coming back and I'm the only one that can save Iris,  I have to do everything I can to make sure that happens.  And you're sure you want to do that?  Because this is not something you can unsee, Wally.  If this is gonna help me save my sister, yeah.  I have to see it.  Please.  Okay, if you have to see it  come on down, be my guest.  H.R., you know how to work this, right?  I know how to work this, yeah.  Anything goes wrong, you get Caitlin down here stat.  I know what I'm doing. I was here the last time.  I saw what you did. All I got to do is do this.   The other one.  It's the other button.  electricity whirs  Bit of a lighter touch next time, please, H.R.!   Copy. Lighter touch.  This way.  Don't!  This is it.  Okay.  So that's the distance I need to cover.  Don't do this!  Now, finally, I am free of you!  sobbing Barry, I love you.  No, don't say that, all right? You're gonna be all right.  Hey, I'm begging you, I'm begging you!   I'm beg sobs  Barry?  You lose, Barry.  No!  grunts  No!    Iris?  Iris, Iris.  Look.  Come on.  What what'd you see? stammering  Was it good? Did that did that help?   Yeah.  Yeah?  It helped a lot.  Wally    Why does nobody ever listen to me?  You're so full of it.   What?  Railing at me  for not telling everyone about Savitar?  What about what you're not telling everyone, Barry?   What are you  Cisco vibed me  into the future. I saw what happened.  Tell my sister why you asked her to marry you.  Go on, tell her the real reason, Barry.  What is he talking about?   Barry.  sighs    The night that Savitar kills you,  you didn't have a ring on your finger.  We weren't engaged yet.  So you thought that if we were  That it might change the future.  Iris  Iris, wait.  Iris, hey. Come on.  Hey, hey, I love you, okay?  I love you more than anything.  That part has never changed. It never will.  Barry, we moved in together after some rash decision  that you made at Christmas,  and then a couple weeks later, you proposed.  You didn't even ask for my dad's permission.  I know. I don't know I guess I got caught  I got caught up in the moment. I  That is exactly what I am afraid of.   Iris, please  Barry, I just  I need time to think.  Hey.  You okay?  I'm worried.  Yeah, I understand.  I keep coming back to the thought that sighs  I could be the cause of all this.  What do you mean?  Savitar's prophecy.  "One will betray you"  You may well have invited Judas into the group, Caitlin.  It's not you.  It's impossible to tell.  Savitar could be controlling me,  and none of us would know about it.  None of us, not even me.  But this time, we know who it is.  How?  dramatic music  Because  I'm the one who betrayed everyone.    How long have you had this?  Ever since you threw the box into the Speed Force.  It's such a small piece.  I didn't think it would really matter.  Why would you even risk it?  Because  I thought I could use it to get rid of my powers.  And can you?  I don't know. I haven't been able to figure out how to use it yet.  Okay, well, look, gang, I think we can all agree  that this is a simple case of the other side  Killer Frost side of Caitlin clouding her better judgment, so  No, H.R. This wasn't her.  It was me.  I'm really sorry, guys.  Right now, we just need to figure out where Savitar is.  Yes, I think that's a fantastic plan.  How are we gonna do that?  Uh   No.  One more time.   No.  No, no.  You want to summon Savitar again?  I am not a human Ouija board, Barry.   You can't just keep  It's the last time, all right?  And only long enough to see  if maybe we can track his location.   Is that possible?  No. No.  Julian, we gotta end this, for everybody's sake.  sighs   I'll see you downstairs.  Oh  Okay, well, you guys can count me out, all right?  'Cause I didn't bring an endless supply of boxers to this planet.  Julian, please.  I should have told you.  I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.  Do you not remember what Savitar had me do with that?  Yes, I do.  But you're not concerned, are you?  You just want your own personal metahuman specialist  to try and find you a cure.  Julian, I don't want these powers.  I can't spend the rest of my life wondering  if or when I'm gonna lose this battle  and become Killer Frost.  I thought you more than anyone would understand that.  You know you know what I understand?  I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.  That's not the only reason.  Yeah, I wish I could believe that.    banging on door  Dad.  I heard what happened.  Thought you might need a pickmeup.  Worked like a charm when you were a kid.  Smaller problems.  Yeah.  So   you wanna talk about it?  I don't know what I want, Dad.  Iris  whatever you may be feeling right now about Barry,  that man does love you.  That that kind of love is rare.  Dad, I wish it were that simple.  chuckles Simple.  Look, only you know  what's good for you.  But with the kind of lives  that you two have,  that love between the two of you,  that is the one thing  that should stay simple.  soft music    sighs Baby girl.  We'll be here if you need anything.  Okay.   electronic beeps  breathing heavily  distorted Back to worship me once again?  We just wanted to let you know that we're gonna defeat you.  Unlikely.  You told us that you're trapped, imprisoned for all eternity.  You're never getting out of wherever my future self locked you up.  You'll never know freedom again.  All will be revealed soon, Flash.  You will face my wrath.  You will beg for mercy,  and you will get none.  electricity whirs   Did it work?  Did it work?  Yeah. We got a hit.  It's just that that hit is all of Central City.  That's not a hit. The whole city?   Yeah.  God. Well  can we get a little more specific?  Pinpoint a location at least uh, something?  I think maybe we can get a little bit more precise,  but I'm gonna have to give it the old metahuman try.  Okay.  It's Iris. All right. I'll be right back, but  just let me know if you get anything, all right?  All right.  Hey.  You going somewhere?  Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.  Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone,  might want to wait on it.  Well, the truth had to come out, so  Yeah, it did.  Just maybe not that way.  I mean, we all have to help each other,  not point fingers.  You're right. I  I'll make it up to them. It's just,  this whole thing is messing with my head.   Don't let it.  You don't get it, Jesse.  When you got your powers,  you were walking down the street.  Me? I touched the Philosopher's Stone,  I got trapped in some cocoon, and  sighs I just feel, because of all of that, I  there's something wrong with me.  I feel like Savitar has some kind of  hold on me.  Look, I know.  Okay? But you're strong, Wally.  You can fight this.  You know, all I ever wanted was to have powers.  To do some good.  But now, now I'm I'm the one responsible  for saving Iris' life.  I don't know if I'm gonna be fast enough to save her, so  Okay, Wally. You're not alone.  Okay.  She's right, Wally.    You're not alone.  dramatic music  Mom.  You're never alone, Wally.   I've missed you so much.  I missed you too.  Wally?  sobbing  I'm so proud of you.  Of what you're trying to become.  That's all I want.  I just want you to be proud of me.  Wally, you're really freaking me out.  I am, son. I'm so very, very proud.  But you have to stop.  What? Why?  You're working so hard.  You don't see how dangerous it is.  Son, you're not fast enough.  You never will be.  But I can't I can't stop. I have to save Iris.   I have to.  Wally.  You're in my head again.  You were always so smart.  distorted Weren't you, Wallace?  But not smart enough.  I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace.  No, not everything.  We still have a piece of that Stone.  Not for long.  And once I have it,  you and everyone you love  will perish.   Wally?  I have to go.  I can't let him get out.   What are you talking about?  Savitar.   You need to tell Barry, okay?  No. I can do this by myself.  Jesse, please, just wait here.  soft music    doors opens, shuts   Hey.  Hey.  I got your message.  Yeah. Come, sit down.  Iris, uh   I know you're mad, but  No, Barry, that's not it.  I just want you to listen. Okay?  I need you to  let me say what I need to say.  Okay.  I'm not angry at you.  I understand that you  you want to keep me safe,  and us getting engaged could change the future.  I I get all of that.  Barry, when you proposed to me  I said yes because  I love you more than anything.  And I want to be your wife.  But I thought that you were asking me purely out of love,  not fear.  And, Barry, whether you realize it or not,  now there's always gonna be a part of us that's tainted.  Iris, I'm trying to save your life.  I know, and that's the problem.  I want to be your wife, Barry.  I don't want to be  someone that you're trying to save  for the rest of eternity.  Eternity.  dramatic music     Can't see anything.  Give me those.   Are those things even working?  Yep.  stammers Stop it!   I just wanna see if they're working.  What are you doing?   What do you see?  I'm seeing these white   flashes, it's like  Flashes?  Yeah, it's like Savitar speeding through, like, a storm.  No, it's not a storm.  It's the Speed Force.  dramatic music  He's in the Speed Force.  That's why only speedsters were able to see him.  Why is Savitar hiding in the Speed Force?  He's not hiding.  That's where the future you trapped him.  That's right.  And that's why Savitar only appears for a few moments at a time,  because the Speed Force just sucks him back in. That makes sense.  But we threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force.  And we gave him the very thing he needed to escape.  Except, he said he still needed one thing.  I don't think he can come out  because he doesn't have the whole Stone.  sighs  Guys Wally went after Savitar.   What?  What?  He started hallucinating.  He thought he was talking to his mom.  No, that's that's not her. That's Savitar.   Where'd he go?  I don't know.  Okay. He was freaking out. He said that  he needed to stop Savitar from getting out,  and he sped off.  The Stone.   It's gone?  It's gone.   Barry, we gotta find Wally.  Yeah.  If Savitar gets ahold of the Stone, then  He'll escape for sure.  I can't find him. He turned off the suit's telemetry.    Oh, come on!  Poor Wallace.  Can't even open a portal.  You can't get rid of that Stone, Wallace.  Like you can't get rid of me.  Oh, shut up, shut up.  You know it's true.  You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force  by yourself.  Shut up!  I'm going to get out of here, Wallace.  And then I'm gonna come for you  and Barry and your sister,  and I'll kill everyone you love.  No, you're not real!  You're just in my head, just  Oh, I'm real,  and I know the limits of your speed.  After all, I'm the one who gave it to you.  And that  giving me speed  that was your biggest mistake.  beeping   There's a massive power surge.  Where?  The old Kob Factory.    Pulling up security footage.  Oh, my God.    Wally.  No!gasping  Aah!  No!  No! Help me, Barry!  Aah!  dramatic music    dramatic music  portal zapping and whooshing  growls  I am free!  Ground.  Air  I can feel again.  I can breathe again.  I've beaten you, finally.  Where's Wally?  What just happened to him?  Like the Greek myth of Atlas,  who could not put down the sky until someone took his place,  Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.  You know me. I love a good myth.  He took your place. What  When you created Flashpoint,  you unwittingly provided me with the means for my return.  Wally  You gave me the idea to turn Wally  into Kid Flash,  to make him fast enough to replace me  in your prison.  His youth and ego were my allies.  So taken with his fame and speed,  he never saw he was running right into my trap.  How do I get him out?   Wally's gone.  How do I get him out?  Suffering in an endless void for all eternity.  Another victim Barry Allen failed to save.  No!    I'm gonna kill you!  If you had the strength to end my life,  you would have done it in the future.  But Barry Allen doesn't kill.  He's the good guy.  The boy Joe raised. The man Iris loves.  You have everything.  And deserve none of it.  I'm going to destroy this city like I did in the future,  so you can see the truth, Barry.  And then, you'll treat me like a god.  You're not a god!  exciting music  winces and coughs  Who are you?  I am the future, Flash.    Show your face.  groans  I want so badly to kill you,  and I will.  But you have to live a little while longer.  Long enough to see Iris die.  roars  winces  The blade didn't hit your organs,  but it did shatter your clavicle.  Hang in there, man, hang in there.   We have to take it out.  Do it!  Any medicine I give you your metabolism will burn through.  All right. Just do it, okay?   Just do it.  Hold him down.  Okay. Gonna be okay, mate. You're gonna be okay.  Bite down on this.  I'm so sorry.  Three, two, one.  screaming   How long was I out?  Not long.  Are you in much pain?  I might be able to do something with this.  dramatic music  Joe.  whispering I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Not your fault.  Where is he?  I mean, is he in pain? Is he  "One will suffer a fate worse than death."  sobbing  Jesse,  I  I'm not like your dad. I don't really  know what the right words are  melancholic music    What are we gonna do?  We have to bring him back. We have to save him  I can't lose Wally, Barry.  I'm sorry.  I'm gonna work on this.  Yeah.  I'll see you soon.  I'm sorry.  I should have never   I was afraid.  I know.  Believe me, I know.  Fear makes us do a lot of things that we shouldn't.  My fear's the reason for all of this.  exciting music
My name is Barry Allen,  and I am the fastest man alive.  To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,  but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,  I fight crime and find other metahumans like me.  In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,  I was accidentally thrust into the future,  and I saw him murder the woman that I love.  But I won't let that happen.  I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future,  and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.  I am The Flash.  Previously, on "The Flash"  The night that Savitar kills you,  you didn't have a ring on your finger.  We weren't engaged yet.  So you thought that if we were  That it might change the future.  Now there's always gonna be a part of us that's tainted.  Why is Savitar hiding in the Speed Force?  That's where the future you trapped him.   That's right.  I have what I need   to escape my hell, Wallace.  Not everything; we still have a piece of that stone.   It's gone?  If Savitar gets ahold of the stone  He'll escape for sure.  You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace.  You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force  by yourself.    Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.  grunting  We have to bring him back. We have to save him.  My fear is the reason for all of this.  Savitar was right.  This is all because of me,  because of my weakness.  Flashpoint.  And because of it, everyone's lives have changed.  Everyone I love is suffering.  This has to stop.  I can't let anyone hurt anymore because of me.  No one else should have to pay for my sins.  And they won't.  Ever again.  Cisco.  Get the breach room ready.  Okay, for what?  I'm gonna save Wally.  How exactly are you going to do that?  I'm going back into the Speed Force.   I'm just trying to wrap my mind around  you going into the Speed Force again.  The Savitar said he was there for years.  You said it was like being in space.   I know.  So what are you gonna do?  You gonna run in there and run around till you find him?   It's endless.  I know.  And this is the only way to save Wally.  Yeah, yeah, I just we need a plan.  I I  I don't wanna lose both my sons.  Look, gang, I don't understand the Speed Force,  but there are plenty of people in this room who do.  Am I correct in assuming there's a point coming?  My point is why can't you use your knowledge  to fashion some kind of safety precaution for young BA right here,  so that, while he's in the Speed Force, he doesn't get lost.  Oh, so you're saying I can just whip up  some kind of interdimensional tether  to just anchor him to the Universe?  Yeah.   That's exactly what I can do.  Yeah!  Now we're cooking with helium.  Yes, and I can I can add a biological component  that will measure his vitals when he's in the Speed Force.   That's a great idea.  Thank you, Caitlin.  Because if we can monitor Barry's vitals,  we'll know if they fluctuate, and we can pull him out.  You mean "pull us out."  Yeah, if you're going in there to save Wally, so am I.  Jesse, you're gonna stay here.  Because if your father finds out you're lost in some negative world,  the first person to get a broken schnoz is me.   There's a negative world?  Yeah, negative world.  Really? They have Super Mario on Earth29?  Oh, yeah, challenge me.  Barry, you need my help. Your shoulder is still broken.  It's okay. It's almost healed.  No, look, I can do this.  I know, but I need you to stay here.  Keep the city safe while I'm gone.  And this is something I have to do alone, okay?  Fine.  Thank you.    Okay, let's go to work.  Can I talk to you?  Yeah.  I'm gonna find Wally.  Whatever's holding him,  whatever's keeping him trapped in there,  I'm gonna get him back.   Okay.  Okay.    Iris  did I lose you?    Bar.  What's going on?  Nothing, nothing.  I'm just trying to make her  not worry so much.  About Wally or you?  Joe, now's not the time, all right?  Look, you  are about to risk your life  to save her brother.  I think now is the perfect time.  She's having doubts about us.  About marrying me.  Did she call off the engagement?  Guess I changed the future one too many times.    I think that's gonna do it.  We should be able to use this to keep track of Barry's vitals.  He'll play astronaut, and we'll play Houston.  Right, but how exactly are you gonna track his location  when he's in the Speed Force?  Well, this is just a simple modification  from what we used to get Barry out last time,  so the electrode halo?  Julian wasn't part of the team last time.   Not yet.  Oh, right.  You know that thing we used to talk to Savitar?  Yes.  Meet the electrode halo.  So basically these two are linked electromagnetically   via Goldtooth.  Goldtooth?  Yeah, it's kind of the Cisco Ramon  interdimensional equivalent of Bluetooth.  Kind of proud of it.  Anyway, it gives us all the relevant locus information  no matter what corner of the multiverse Barry's stuck in.  And, if Barry needs our help,  it'll stimulate Cisco's prefrontal cortex.  And I'll open a breach and  pop send him back in.  Good Lord, multiverses, breaches, halos,  easy bloody peasy.  By George, I think he's got it.  Cisco, you about ready?  Born ready.    Okay.  Here's winging it.  Winging it? Wait, what do you mean?  Well, I mean, I don't really have a map of the Speed Force,  so when I vibe Barry into it  You have no idea where I'm gonna land.  But the good news is, if he gets stuck  on the wrong side of the tracks, now we can fish him out.    Find my boy.  I'm gonna do whatever it takes.    Thank you.  I love you, Iris.    I love you too.    Are we ready?  Good to go.    To infinity and beyond.    Okay, once I let go, you're on your own.  Do it.    Good luck.    thunder rumbles  eerie music    thud    Wally?  thunder rumbles    clattering  Wally?    thunder rumbles    Hello?    Hey, Bar.    dramatic music    Why are you here?  Why did you come back to this place?  I'm here to save Wally West.  Ever the hero, huh, Barry?  It's my fault that he's trapped here.  Is it?  Where is Wally West?  He's not exactly here, per se.  He's in the prison you created.  Well, your future self, that is.  How do I get him out?  How do I get him out?  I think you'll find we're not gonna be  as accommodating as we were the last time you visited us.  What the hell does that mean?  It means things have changed.  We gave you your speed back because you said  you'd come to terms with your mother's death,  but you lied to us.   I  You went back in time,  and saved her.  And, in doing so, you created Flashpoint.  Zoom had just killed my father.  We know, and we understand,  which is why we allowed you to do that,  but choices have consequences.  And I'm afraid we can't let you make any more choices like that.  Wally is just a kid.  He's a Flash.  He made his choice.  Now he has to live with it,  just like you do.  I'm not going anywhere until Wally's free.  Then be prepared to spend an eternity in here.    Why would you order a single espresso?  It's gotta be at least a double espresso.  I can go triple. slurps   Doesn't affect me at all.  Frightening.  I can have a quadruple, a sextuple.  Oh, there you are. I'm gonna get us all coffees  'cause we got a lot of work to do, you know?  A lot of a lot of stuff to do.  It doesn't affect me though. It doesn't affect me at all!  Okay.   He scares me.  Yeah. chuckles  I was wondering, do you think you could use this  to track Savitar's location?  That's not a bad idea.  You know, I couldn't before because he was in the Speed Force,  but, now that he's out of it,  feeling footloose and fancyfree, I'm sure chuckles  I'm sorry, you know what? That was insensitive of me.   It's fine.  Okay, so  let's say I find Savitar, right now.  What are you gonna do about it?  I'm gonna go after him.  Jesse, are you out of your mind?  No, okay? I can't just sit here waiting.  You can, and you will.  We all will. And, soon enough,  Barry's gonna get Wally out of the Speed Force.  You don't know that, okay?  We don't know anything.  The only thing we actually know is that Savitar is out there,  and, if we can, we have to find him  and send him right back where he came from.  You're staying here.  sighs      Iris.    I wrote that article.  That used to be my byline, but  not anymore.    Well, 2024 is a long ways away.  Things could still change.    What if it's too late?  What if some things can't be undone?    sighs  You having second thoughts?  I guess I'm just worried that  I made the wrong decision.  And what?  You think that calling things off  sent Barry running into the Speed Force?  Please, we both know  that he was gonna go save Wally no matter what.  Yeah, that's just the kind of hero he is.    Sweetheart, I know I know how you're feeling.  You can't figure out which way's up right now, can you?    Do yourself a favor.  Look deep inside that big, beautiful heart of yours.  You'll find the answer you're looking for.    Eddie Thawne's life was almost so different.  Iris was about to be his wife.  Joe was about to be his fatherinlaw.  But things didn't turn out that way, did they, Barry?  gunshot  thunder rumbles    Instead of that life being his legacy  this is.    So the only reason you came back is to save Wally.  Yes.  There's no other reason?  No.  All right then, Bar.  If you want Wally, all you need to do  is go through those doors.  ding    But you're gonna have to outrun that thing first.  snarling  Time Wraith.  roars  dramatic music    shrieks    tense music    baby crying    Hush, little baby, don't say a word   Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird   Caitlin.  baby crying    And if that mockingbird don't sing   Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring   That baby    is she  Beautiful.  Just like her mother.  Ronnie.  Hello, Barry.  We need to talk.    Perhaps some sort of new metal akin to a Luttinger liquid?  What do you think?  Man, I don't know what this is.  All I know, it just came off the armor  of some Hindu speed god, so  It's like the box the philosopher's stone came in.  It simultaneously exists and doesn't exist.  Like Schroeder's cat. Remember Schroeder?  Guy with the cat in the box both dead and alive  at the same time, dun, dun, dun, which, by the way,  seems like cruelty for animals half the time.  Okay, I think you're thinking of Schrodinger, maybe?   Schroding no.  Yeah, 'cause Schroeder's  the guys from "Peanuts."   I don't think so.  Yeah, the one with the piano.   Yeah.  The  Charlie Brown has the piano on my Earth.  That's the whole gag 'cause he can't play the piano.   He's terrible.  No.  Oh, my God, who cares about cats or pianos   or the freaking "Peanuts"?  It's not "The Peanuts."  It's just "Peanuts."  You have been studying this thing for hours.  Can we or can we not use it to track Savitar?  Okay, all right, wind it in.  As far as we can tell, the shard is made of nearfrictionless material  that's in a constant state of flux.  So while it's utterly motionless on the outside  It's constantly moving on the inside.  Yes, it's as if it's being affected by some sort of external source,  much like the tides are affected by the phases of the moon.  Okay, okay, then it has to be Savitar.  I mean, this was part of his armor.  Maybe it's trying to reconnect with its other pieces.  That's it.  It's just like "The Iron Giant."  If this is true, then this shard could lead us right to him.  That's an idea.  Okay, all right, so what are we waiting for?   Let's  ping  Hold your roll, Jesse Quick.  This hesitation that you feel, on behalf of the group,  is our realization that this "go for broke" attitude  is the very attitude that got Wallace in his predicament  in the first place. Am I right?  I can't believe I'm uttering the words,  but I actually agree with H.R.   Ditto.  Thanks, boys.  A lone speedster  it's just no match for Savitar.   Yeah, but  Jesse, we're gonna find him.  When?  When the real Flash gets back.  That came out wrong, um  Wow.  Put my foot in it.  Jesse, Jesse!  Oh, Jesse, hey, Jesse, quick question:  Merlot or Cabernet?  What?  What wine do you think would go best  with a big, old men's size 11 shoe stuffed in his mouth?   H.R.?  Yeah?   Just leave me alone.  I get it, I get it.  I get Savitar  Savitar hurt the one you love,  now you wanna hurt Savitar.  Yeah, bet your ass, I do.  No, I get it. I I love it.  I respect it. I'm a little worried though  that, in your zeal for payback, you might be the one  who ends up getting hurt.   On my Earth  Yeah.   I am the real Flash.  I know.  That's why I gagging  I should've said what I said.  No, no, you shouldn't have, okay?  'Cause I've fought plenty of monsters before.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like Savitar, though?  'Cause, look, here's the thing.  If your father were here, he would  He would do everything in his power to stop Savitar.  And that is exactly what I'm gonna do.  laughs  Okay, okay.  I mean, hats off to you.  You really are HardHat Harry's little girl, aren't you?  Yeah, I am, and you're not him.  So just do us both a favor and stop trying to be.    This troubles you.  Another life that could've been and never was.    Caitlin and Ronnie should've had that.  A family, a future.  The future doesn't always turn out as we want it to.    I see what you're doing.  First Eddie, now Ronnie,  showing me all of the people  who sacrificed themselves for the greater good.  No, Barry, their sacrifices were for you,  as was Wally's when he attempted to stop Savitar.  No, Savitar tricked Wally.  And now he's trapped.  Wally doesn't belong in the Speed Force.  You have to let me take his place.  And that's why I'm here.  Or the other reason, Barry.  I wanna sacrifice myself for Wally.   We can't allow that.  Why not?  Because where Wally's gone is a hell all his own.  Savitar said, "One will suffer a fate far worse than death."  And it's not for you.  Leave, Barry, while you still can.    No.    Whatever hell Wally's trapped in, I'm gonna set him free,  and I'm not leaving here until I do.  Very well, but you were warned.  snarling    grunts  roars  Hunter Zolomon.  dramatic music    Come on, come on.    shrieks  ding    roars   Is it Barry?  Did something happen to him?  We don't know.

I can't.  You're not gonna talk me out of this, okay?   I already told you you're not   Not your dad.  That message was received loud and clear.  Now hear mine.  Taking on Savitar all alone  is not gonna bring Wallace back, Jesse.  It's just gonna get you killed, and that,  my friend, that is not happening.  Not on my watch.  You done?  Yeah, said my piece.  And guess what?  I'm still not  smack  moving  thud    That was oddly satisfying.    What's happening to him?  Wally West is caught in an endless temporal loop,  just like Savitar after you imprisoned him here in the future.  No wonder he hates you.    What's he seeing?  He's reliving the single most painful moment of his life  over and over again.  His mother's death.  Wally.  He doesn't deserve this.  Let me guess. You do?  I know what my hell is.  I've already seen it in the future.  You don't like the future, Flash?   Change it.  I can't.  Don't you get it? I can't!  I'm not fast enough. He is.    That's why you have to let me take his place.  Wally can save Iris.  Not learning your lesson, Barry.  You keep telling us one thing and then doing another.    You wanna know what inspired Leonard Snart  to sacrifice himself?  It was you, Barry Allen.  You inspired him to be better.  You inspired him to be selfless,  to sacrifice himself for others,  to be a hero,  just like you.  I'm no hero.  Not lately.  So what?  You've had enough, Scarlet Speedster?  Time to hang up the cowl and give it all up?  Well, if you're out  you're out.  I'm done fighting.  We know, and that's exactly the problem.  zap  grunts    You think seeing Iris' death is hell?  You ain't seen nothing yet.  zap    Let's get you out of here.    Okay, you stupid piece of metal,  take me to your leader.    Gotcha.  dramatic music    Jesse Quick.  I knew you would come for me.    How'd you know I was coming here?  Because I know everything that happens.  I've already lived it.   I'm not afraid of you.  You should be.  dramatic music    electric crackling  grunts  Jesse.  H.R.?  It's a little late to talk me out of this, okay?  I'm not gonna try and talk you out of anything. I learned that lesson.  You have something that belongs to me.    grunting  I need a little help here, H.R.   Bum, bum, thinking.  Think faster.  What do we got? We're fighting Savitar.  Savitar is a speed god. He's omnipotent.  He's invulnerable.  Then why does he need a suit of armor?  Jesse, he's vulnerable somewhere under the suit.  Find a gap, find an opening, and go for it.  grunts  I have such plans for you in the future, Jesse Quick.  And I have plans for you too.  This is for Wally.  Ahh!  Yeah!  roars    Jay.  Yeah?  Is this really you,  or is this  just another Speed Force test?  Yeah, kid, it's really me.  How?  As soon as the team lost contact with you,  Cisco came to my Earth and told me what was happening.  I came here to help.   Let's get Wally.  zap  grunts  'Fraid I can't let you do that.  Getting a little slow in your golden age there, Garrick.   Stop.  Can't do that either.  zap  dramatic music    zap  Enough!  I'm taking Wally.  We can't let you do that, Barry.  Yeah? Try and stop me.    vibrating    Wally?     Hey, Wally.  machines beeping  Hey.  Barry, Jay.  sniffling   I saw my mom.  I know,   I know.  My mom.  I know. Look at me now, okay?  It's over.  You're free now, okay?  We're going home, all right?  It's okay.  We're going home.    Jay, let's go.  Sorry, kid,  this is where I stay for a while.  What? What are you talking about?  We both know that a speedster  needs to take Wally's place.  That's why I'm here.  No, no, Jay, you already lived your hell  when you were Zoom's prisoner.  And you set me free, and I owe you for that.   Jay  I've run a hell of a race,  but every marathon has a finish line.  Time's finally come for me to cross it, but you  you, Barry,  need to put an end to this once and for all  and stop Savitar.    How?  Do what you do best.  Be The Flash.    Cisco said that he could use this to track you  and bring you home.    I'm gonna get this back to you again,  when I break you out of here.    See you soon, Flash.     electric crackling  What's happening?  Do you think you can reel them in?  I don't know.  I've never felt this much harmonic feedback.  It feels like the Speed Force is about to     Wally!  Barry!  Oh, my God.  Are you okay?  We will be.    Hold on a second.  Three speedsters go in, and only two come out.  Jay  Jay stayed back  to save Wally.    Come on, Wally, let's get you checked out.    I thought I lost both my boys.   Thanks for bringing him back.  You're welcome.    Thank you.    I thought I'd lost you too.    I'm right here.    dramatic music  The Speed Force.  And it just appeared to you in the form of Eddie Thawne?   And Ronnie?  And Snart.  All to teach me another lesson.  Which was what?  Saving Iris is my responsibility and mine alone.  It's why the Speed Force didn't let me take Wally's place,  why Jay sacrificed himself to do it.  So I could finish this.  Jay,  hero among heroes.  Yeah.  We can't just leave him in there.  We won't.  I'll beat Savitar. We'll get him out.  Good, 'cause it seems to me the Speed Force  is a little bit of a crazy place.  Just ask Wallace.  Yeah, yeah, what  what Wally saw  it's gonna haunt him for a while.  So until he can get past it, and he's really ready  to go back out there, Kid Flash is  gonna need to take a break for a while.    Hey.  You okay?  Are you?  Right.  You should see the other guy.  Caitlin said I'll be fine.  Jesse, I can't believe you went after Savitar by yourself.  What were you thinking?  The same thing you were when you did it.  Yeah, that was a mistake.  One that I will never make again.  Yeah, yeah, me either.  Not on this Earth, anyway.  Wait, what? You're going back to Earth2 already?   Earth3, actually.  But you just got here, Jesse.  I know, I know, and I want to be with you.  It's just Savitar said he had plans for me in the future.  I can't let that happen.  Besides, until Barry can get Jay out of the Speed Force,  Earth3 needs a Flash to protect it.    I love you, Jesse.    I love you too.    You show those villains on Earth3.  Nobody messes with our Jesse Quick.   That's right. You give them hell.  You know I will.  We're here if you need us, all right?   Safe travels.  Thanks.  Sorry for the, uh  Yeah, yeah, me too.   Good lefthook.  Thanks.  I shouldn't be surprised. Us Wellses  we are forces to be reckoned with.  That we are.  Thank you, H.R.  For what?  Just being a friend.    Thank you.  Yeah.     You ready?  Yeah.    This isn't goodbye.  No, it's more like "see you later."  I can't wait.    So, fun fact  uncovered by our intrepid Jesse Quick,  in her latest dustup with the socalled "God of Speed,"  guess who feels pain.  What what exactly are you saying?  Are you saying that underneath the suit of armor that's he's  Yes, James. He's not a god.  He's just a man, baby.   A man?  Yeah.    Hey.  Hey.  sighs  Thank you for saving Wally.  Of course.  Um,  clears throat  so, I just  Look, you told me that you only wanted to marry someone  because they love you  and not because they were trying to save you,  and I get that.  I just  you know, I've lived with a lot of death,  tragedy in my life,  and seeing you die    it's impossible not to be consumed by that.  Yeah, no, I get that.  I do.  It just  it made me question if you were asking me  for the right reasons, you know?  If it was out of love or  sighs responsibility.    But, look,  while you were gone, I realized something.  I don't have to doubt why you wanna marry me.  It's the same reason that I wanna marry you.  Mmhmm.  I wanna be your wife, Barry.    Um    I love you.    But,  uh    you were right.  I proposed  because I thought it would save you.  I thought Wally would save you.  I  I was wrong.  I alone have to save you in the future, and I'm going to,  but not by changing it.  By embracing it.  Okay, um clears throat  what what does that mean?  It means that  II think we need some space for a while.    I'm sorry, but II don't I don't know how we can  move forward like this, with    Um    okay.    I guess I'll go to my dad's.  No, you stay here. I'll  I'll stay with Cisco.Next time you decide to release my friend's inner ice demon,  you do it sometime in July.  I was trying to save her life, Cisco.  When I became Killer Frost,  Savitar appeared to me and showed me the way.  If the answers that we need to stop Savitar  and save you are in the future,  then that's where I need to go.  You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.  Just tell me how you did it.   I had help.  Help from who?  A physicist. Her name's Tracy Brand.  thunder booming, electrical zapping  ominous suspenseful music    I know who you are.     soft dramatic music   Whew!     Cecile?  giggles  Most people quit  their New Year's resolutions by now.  Uhuh. Central City Marathon is in two months,  and I gotta shave ooh!  I still got half a minute I gotta take off my time.   You?  A lot more than 30 seconds.  Look, I am going to wait for you  at the end of the marathon.  No, you're not pulling out of this thing.  I am not as easy with running  as some other members of my family.  Mm, I'm gonna let it slide. I'm gonna let it.   Yeah?  Yeah.   Are you getting mad?  both laugh  I would never get mad.  I love you too much to be mad.  Uh, um  that, uh I, uh   I didn't really mean to  No, absolutely   I was looking at you,  cell phone buzzes  and then it just came out, and I didn't want you   to feel uncomfortable or  I'm sorry. Hold on.  Sorry. I gotta take this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.  Yeah? Okay. I'm on my way.  Yeah.  All right, sorry.  I gotta head out.    Her name is Tracy Brand.  She's one of the world's top theoretical physicists  you know, or at least she will be.  No kidding. Girl Scout earns her merit badges.  2021 Nobel Prize, Copley Medal,  presidential commendation.  She's a genius, but what's that to us?  She's the key to stopping Savitar.  Future me said that four years from now,  Dr. Brand invents the technology  that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.  Four years too late.  Yeah, but if she invents the tech then,  then maybe she's working on the prototype now.  That's exactly right, so we should find her.  Agreed.  Sorry  why are we not looking for Caitlin again?  Easy, Romeo and Juliet.  None of us have forgotten about Caitlin.  Right, but future Flash already confirmed  that she teams up with Savitar.  We should be doing everything in our power   to stop that from happening.  Both: We know.  Right, so what is Wally doing  swanning off to Earth3 to be with his girlfriend?  He could be here right now looking for her.  It's like no one's doing a thing.  No one's doing a thing?  Barry and Wally searched the city half a dozen times.  No one's doing a thing? Every chance I get,  I try to vibe where she is.  We're using facial recognition technology.  We're using the metahuman app, the satellite.  We're doing everything we can.  I just want her back, okay?  Yeah, well, if you wanted her here so badly,  maybe you shouldn't have ripped off that necklace   and turned her into a killer.  Okay, okay.   All right.  Just saying.  computer chimes  We got a hit.  Tracy Brand, currently enrolled in CCU's Theoretical Physics program.  So our hopes of defeating an evil speed god   hinge on a grad student?  Yup.  Could be worse. B.A., Cisco, let's do this.  Let's go.    Ahh, the soulsucking fluorescence of academia.  Yeah, this is exciting, though.  It's like meeting Norbert before he was Einstein.   Albert.  Norbert Albert?  Do you guys smell that?   sniffs  Toast?  gas hissing  Holy  dramatic music  Hey!

What  My work.  Well, I don't know why they call it "work,"  because none of it works.  This isn't exactly what I expected.   Me neither.  Um, Dr. Brand?  Oh, no. Just Tracy.  I failed my dissertation.  Nothing like ten years down the drain  and a pile of debt as a legacy.  Tracy, uh, wwwe were just hoping  that you'd have a moment to talk.  Oh, no. My bus leaves in five minutes.  Oh, please tell me I didn't burn my bus ticket.   Uh  Yeah, that's hot.  Your bus? Where where are you going?  Big Belly Burger. I hear they're hiring.  laughs  What? You're seri  Well, what about all your research?  Oh chuckles you mean my  "unsubstantiated and transactional" inquiry  into the "purely suppositional" nature  of extradimensional energy?   Both: Yes?  Yeah?  A waste of time, or, as Dr. Hersh puts it,  "A total misapplication of the university's resources."  I might as well start practicing,  "Do you want fries with that?"   Yes.  No.   B.A.  Stop.  Look, don't let the naysayers get you down.  Your doubts, they're traitors.  Don't believe them. Your mind is too fine to waste  turning tubers into finger chips.  Finger chips?   Finger chips. There's, like, a  He's from out of town. H.R!  Stop. Look, look, look. You can't give up.  Your work on relativistic quantum mechanics  and its application to interspatial theory  to manipulate matter on a subatomic level,  it's groundbreaking.  I haven't shared that hypothesis with anyone,  other than my therapist.   Who are you?  We're therapists.   Yeah.  ice crackling  tense music  glass shatters  Admission here is so easy.  dramatic music    Get her out of here.

Hey!   Hey, you good?  Yeah.   That's gonna leave a mark.  Come on, come on.  groans     Caitlin's after Tracy.  Yeah.  That means she's working with Savitar.  soft dramatic music  That's definitely her, Detective.  Icy eyes and all.  sighs Yup, that's her.    So I'm gonna spread this around  so everyone knows to look for her.   Uh, can you give me one second?  Mmhmm.  Uh, so if Caitlin wants Tracy dead,  I guess what you saw in the future was true  and she's teamed up with Savitar.  I just didn't think it was gonna happen this soon.  It certainly makes things more complicated.  Makes what more complicated?  Uh tthere was a meta attack at CCU,  and we just don't have much to go off of.  Really? It's a college campus.   Isn't there video footage?  Uh, no.  It got erased.  Uh, well, I'm sure you two will figure it out.  Joe, can I, um   Yeah.  Yeah.  sighs  So I'm feeling weird about this morning.  Uh  Look, when I told you that I loved you,  II didn't mean to make you feel pressured.  No, no, no, no, II didn't feel pressured.  Okay. So  we're good?   We're great.  Great. Okay.  Um, in that case, uh  good luck with your meta.    Um, so I totally heard that.   Do you want to talk?  No. Hey, where are you going?  Oh, uh, nearest bus stop.  Uh, no, you should stay here,  um, with Detective West for a little bit.  Why? That sketch artist was like freaking Michelangelo.   I mean, you've got your woman.  Not yet.  And until we do, you could be in a lot of danger.  You really think Jack Frost's sister wants to kill me?   I'm no one.  In my experience,  if she's come after you once, she's likely to do it again.  Look, this whole witness overprotection thing  is totally unnecessary.   It was just a random attack.  cell phone chimes  Oh! The bus is coming.  I gotta go.  We need to keep an eye on her.  Yeah, we do.  dramatic music    She got away.  I told you exactly where she'd be.  Barry and Cisco were there when I arrived.  As I told you they would be.  Maybe there's more Caitlin Snow inside you  than you led me to believe.  Are you saying I let her go on purpose?  Did you?  You call yourself Killer Frost,  but you haven't actually killed anyone yet.  You and I can both be gods,  free of the pain and suffering of man.  All you have to do  is kill the girl.  tense music  Okay. groans Look, I might not have any cash.  But I have one of those, um, Jitters cards  that has ten stamps on it,  which means you owe me a free drink.  Okay?  Allow moi to help out a damsel in distress.  I will pay for myself and the lady.  I will have a tripleshot, nowhip mocha Flash,  and anything this young lady desires.  Yeah, I, um I need to calm down, so a Zoom.   A Zoom?  Mmhmm.  Never heard of it.   Oh, it's on the secret menu.  Secret menu?  Triple espresso with a shot of cayenne.   clicks tongue and whistles  Marry me.  Hey, wait. You were at the college this morning.  No oh, this morning? Oh, yeah.  No, I remember you now.  Yes, I was. H.R.  Wait, what is it with you people?  Did the CCPD send you to find me?  No, no, no, no. The reason I'm here is  my team and I  are very interested in your research.   Really?  Yes.  You're interested in my theories on quantum mechanics?  Your ideas of waveparticle duality,  your quantization of energy,  and your timesymmetric formulation  of quantum theory and   How the boundary conditions  lead to principle causality  and the psychological arrow of time.  And the psychological arrow of time.  You really know your stuff.  Well, je suis  smart.  Lay off the French, and lay off the improv too, please.  Just keep her talking.  Ah.  Thank you, Mischa.  Please. The Zoom.   Thank you.  You're welcome.  Let's zoom.  Mate, was it just me,  or did it sound like H.R. was trying to flirt?  Hmm. Didn't notice.  Listen, the, uh, security footage today from CCU,  the stuff that we wiped to protect Caitlin's identity?  II saw it.  As in, II saw the two of you squaring off.  Okay.  Well, from the angle that I saw,  it looked like you had a pretty clear shot.  Okay.  You had a clear shot, Cisco, and you didn't take it.   Why?  Julian, I'm trying to focus  on what we're here to focus on. I suggest you do the same.  dramatic music  Gents, how we doing?  Uh, all good.  I don't know about this one, Bar.  H.R. isn't exactly our best closer.  Ah, he'll be fine.   Are you okay?  Yeah.   Just  Cecile?  sighs  She's just she caught me off guard.  Mmhmm?  Just didn't think we were there yet.  Well, obviously she is.   Are you?  II care for her a lot.  It's just with everything going on  with Iris and Savitar  and now Caitlin, I just feel like I  lie to Cecile all the time.  Then maybe you should stop.  You're gonna have to tell her about Wally  and me and all this at some point, right?  So why not now?  Well, just so you know,  you don't have to keep her in the dark for us.  If you love her, you should be honest with her.  At least that's what you'd tell me to do.     Okay, so  Mmhmm?  here's the thing that I could never get them to understand  at the university. See   I've been studying speedsters.  Oh.  And so you know how,  when they run, they generate a trail   of lightning behind them?  Light lightning.  I don't think all of that is generated by them running.   I think  No?   some of it comes from somewhere.   Mmhmm.  Like, it's some sort of a  like a hmm.  Speed Force?  suspenseful music  Yeah.   Wait. That is a great term for it.  chuckles Well   Speed Force.  stammers Thanks.  Anyway, so I've been doing some calculations.  Mmhmm?  I think there might be a way to manipulate it.  Mmhmm?  Maybe even  control it.  Maybe even turn it into a prison.  Maybe. Um, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. chuckles  I mean just a random thought.  How do you think one would accomplish that?   See, I don't know  Okay.  because the university wouldn't fund my research.  Ahh, mmhmm.  Why are you so interested in this?  Because everybody thinks I'm a crackpot.  gentle music  I certainly don't think you're a crackpot.    ice crackling  I  What's wrong?  dramatic music  We should go.   Wait.

And he's from the future?   Yup.  And I build a trap for him?   Me?  You.  He wants to kill you before you build it.  That's why he's sending Killer Frost after you.  Killer Frost? Her name is Killer Frost?   Yeah.  We know it's a lot to take in.  Well, to be fair, you're basically telling me  I'm Sarah Connor in "Terminator."   Well  Uh, more like   Miles Dyson.  Yeah,   but good effort, though.  So wait.  You're telling me my ideas about the, um  The Speed Force.  Speed Force, being able to control it,  manipulate it, all of that  I'm right?  It appears so.  device chimes  That's me?  laughs  Nobel Prize?  All of that?  In the future, yeah.  sighs  Look, Tracy.  device chimes  We need your help.  We need you to build this trap now.  What happens if I don't build the trap?  Someone very important to us is going to die.  soft dramatic music    I'm sorry.  Excuse me.    Uh, I know that, uh,  normally one of you fellas  goes out for the chat, but, uh  I got this one.  Tracy!  Oh, Tracy!    light knocking  I'm working.  I can see.  I thought you'd like to be informed  that H.R. has managed to talk Tracy around.  Ah, perfect. That means we can get to work.  Yeah, there's one thing I need to know first.  Outside Jitters earlier,  you could've stopped Caitlin with a vibe.  But just like CCU, you didn't.  I'm not doing this again.  No, no, no, no, no.  You are.  I need to know, Cisco.  Tell me why you couldn't do it.  Get out of my way.  Caitlin could be home now.  Had you stopped her, she would be here.  But you didn't! You couldn't!  Tell me why!  Because I'm afraid!   Afraid of what?  Afraid of killing her!  tense somber music  I'm walking around with two loaded guns here,  ready to go off.  What if she's hurting Barry or Joe or you  and I have to save you and I can't control my powers  and I end up killing her?  She's my best friend.  And I'd rather it be me than her.    Hey.  Hey.  How's Tracy holding up?  Ah, we'll see.  Um  clears throat  Have you told Cecile about us yet?  Cecile is the only thing  normal I have in my life right now,  and I like having something normal.  If I tell her about all this  that goes away.  But if you don't tell her   There may not be an "us."  Mmhmm.  Joe, there's no such thing as normal.  Love is the only thing that makes the fight worth it,  and it's the only thing that's gonna get us through it.    Guys. Guys, there you are.  We got a big problem.  Tracy's gone.  tense music    I checked CCU, her apartment, and Jitters.  Tracy's not in any of them.  I'll bet you Savitar and Killer Frost  are hunting her down as we speak.  H.R., you were with Tracy last.   How did she seem?  Rattled, Miss West.  Rattled, but I gave her a rousing and reassuring pep talk,   so I think she's okay.  Oh, that's why she left.  That's not why look, I will have you know  my book on motivational speeches, "All's Wells that Ends Wells"   Tracy is in danger.  You're right.   Iris!

Now.  Yeah, we gotta find her.  sighs Where else could she be?  Oh! snaps fingers  Why don't we start with her future hologram, right?  That's that would give us insight   into her psyche, no?  Of course, yeah.   That's pretty good.  Thank you.   Thanks.  You're welcome.  device beeps  sighing  tense music   She's cute.  This is creepy, right?   Yeah.  I find her charming.  Do you think you could screenshot a hologram?  Go back to that last one.  Yeah, there's another one like it.  Whoa, whoa, look at that.   Zoom in.  Yeah.     Eppur si  snaps fingers  Eppur si muove.  Tracy, you blessed paramour of science.  Gang, I know exactly where she is.  pensive music    Eppur si muove.  "And yet it moves."  Galileo's famous statement uttered moments  after being forced to recant his theory that the Earth  revolves around the sun.  "And yet it moves."  Mocha Flash for me.   A Zoom for milady.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  How did you know I was here?  Um, I might have done a bit of holographic stalking.  I stalked you holographically.  You mean, in the future, I'm still obsessed  with a 500yearold Italian polymath?  laughing Yes, it would appear so.  I'm sorry I ran off.   I just  No.  just needed to clear my head and think   Of course.   and this is where I do it best.  Well, I can see that. That statue is nothing if not inspiring.  Concrete beard, foreboding, smart.   Totally inspiring.  Yup.  You know,  Galileo's peers thought he was a crackpot too.   Is that right?  Yeah.  And I used to find that comforting.   Oh.  But then when your team  showed me the future  and showed me that my crazy ideas  aren't so crazy after all,  I just felt more intimidated than ever.  Well, I can see that.  It's like you're sitting in the shadow of greatness.   Your own greatness, right?  Exactly!  It's like I've failed so many times.  That's all I know how to do.  I don't know how to be that  brilliant woman in the hologram.    But you wouldn't understand.  You are a born genius.  Yeah, about that.  Um, I'm not  technically a genius.  That was a cheap thing to do. I'm sorry I misled you  about me being a genius.  The point is, you  are a genius.  You are. I know it.  I can I can feel it.  It's right there. It's right there,  just brimming just below the surface.   It is?  Yes, absolutely!  Yes, it is, Tracy.  And you can defeat Savitar.  All you need is to just believe in yourself.  And for what it's worth  I already do.    sighs  knock at door  groans softly   Hi.  Hey.  I didn't know you were dropping by.  Yeah, well, if you had read any of my texts, you'd know.  Yeah. Um   I'm sorry.  I know.  It's why I'm here. Look, I  You know, it doesn't take a detective to see  that something's not right.  Look, Cecile  Is it because I said, "I love you," this morning?  Because, Joe, it's it's okay  if you're not ready to say it back.  No, no. It's not about that.  No? Well, then what's going on?  'Cause you've been acting weird all day.  I mean, not just with us this morning  but at work with that meta case.  You gotta give me something, Joe.  All I can say is  that part of my life is very complicated.  And if you were to become part of that,  your life would be very complicated,  and it would change us.  And I mean change us forever.  chuckles softly  That's not a bad thing, you know.  It's called growth.  And then I was thinking about  what you said this morning, and  it told me where you were.  It also showed me where I was, and  and you add those complications,  and I think we should stop seeing each other.  Really?  somber music  That's what you think we should do?  III think it's the best thing for both of us.  Here I was, thinking that being together  was the best thing for both of us.    I guess I'll, uh  I'll see you around the station, Joe.    knock at door    gasping   Cecile!  Joe!   No!  Joe!  Guarantee you I'm faster.  Caitlin  we can talk about this.  I'll talk. You listen.  In an hour, you're gonna get a message with an address.  Bring me Tracy Brand,  or I will kill your little sweetheart.  sobbing Joe.  Wait!  Cecile screams  groans  dramatic music    So you're saying that if we don't turn Tracy  over to Killer Frost  She's gonna kill Cecile.  Correct me if I'm wrong,  but Tracy is our key to finding Savitar, right?  Yes, but what are we gonna do?  We gonna just let Killer Frost  live up to her name and kill somebody?  Not if I have anything to say about it.  All I'm saying is,  we need to do whatever it takes to save her.  No one's gonna die, all right?  We're gonna get her back. I promise.  cell phone chimes  That's them.  They're at the old Dressler Factory.  Okay, we know where they are. That's something.  So what do we do?  I have a plan.  Cisco, can I have a quick word?   Not now, Julian.  Listen, please, mate.  Just just hear me out.  soft dramatic music  I know you're terrified of losing her.  So am I.  I know you're you're worried  about not being able to control your powers,  but I know you can.  I don't think your abilities have ever come from a place  of of negativity or or hate.  They come from somewhere good.  They come from love.  And if you can find it in you to stop her,  then I really think we can save her.    Cheers, mate.    Hi.  Yeah, you know how I said, you know,  we were gonna keep you safe? drumming on leg  Um, yeah.  So, um, now I need to ask you  to do something dangerous.  dramatic music swells    Cecile!   Are you all right?  Joe!  I'm okay. She didn't hurt me.  That's because killing you  does nothing for me.  dramatic music  Killing you, Tracy? That's everything.    Hand her over.  You don't have to do this.   Yes, I do.  Why?  Because Savitar commands it?  He's not a god.  He's just a man that's using you.   Come on, you're one of us.  One of us?   We're family.  We're family?  Both: We protect each other till the end.  chuckling  How are you doing that?  Savitar told me everything you'd say.  You two are more alike than you realize.  You see, that's how Savitar knows every move  you're going to make.  He's always one step ahead of you,  because this is all history to him.  That's how I know Cisco's in the rafters right now.  bomb beeping  Oh, no.  detonator clicks   whoosh  explosion booms     grunts  ice crackling  ice shatters on ground    grunting    It's over, Caitlin.    Caitlin is dead.  Not to me.    Go. Go. Go. Go.   grunts  ice crackling  grunts    shouts  panting   vibration humming  grunts  both panting  Caitlin.  You're alive.  panting  I'm sorry.  I had to stop you to save you.    whoosh  grunts  whoosh  dramatic choral music  My ascension is nearly at hand, Flash.  As I rise, you will fall.    whoosh    How do we keep surviving these things?  Because we're in control of our fates.  And how did she know I was up in the rafters?  Is she psychic now too?  And that thing where you guys were talking at the same time?  How do you think she was doing that?  I don't know. She said Savitar told her  what was gonna happen.  No way, man. This wasn't just brushing up on days to come.  This was precise. Scary precise.   Like Savitar was there.  Mmhmm.  What I don't understand is why Savitar  wouldn't kill Tracy when he showed up.  I mean, why would he choose to rescue Caitlin?  He needs her for something.  We gotta figure out what that is.  Agreed.  Thanks to Cisco, we now have a sample of her blood  when she was fully mutated as Killer Frost.  This?  It could be the key to reverse engineering a cure, so  it's good work, mate.  You too.  chuckling Oh, there you are.  I brought us some coffee treats.  Unfortunately, we were all out of cayenne.   Careful, that's hot.  gasps Ah!  Yeah, hot, hot, sorry.  How are you? Oh! Ha! Whoo!   Careful.  Ah, how are you holding up?   Whew, it's hot.  Well   I'm processing.  Mmhmm.  That was really  I mean, the voice   blubbers  And the "whoom!"   Pshh!  Killer Frost? Savitar?  You know some people with really scary names.  Eh, but is it too much?  All of us here would understand.  Personally, I just I just wanna make sure  that, you know, you don't get hurt.  As a matter of fact, I was thinking   I was thinking too.  Yeah?   About Savitar.  Mmhmm?  The way the light reflects off his suit,  it's unlike any other metallic compound I have ever seen.  Hmm, you and I were thinking about different things.   What do you think it is?  In Fermi liquid theory,  any sort of nonFermi liquid   is called "strange metal."  Mmhmm.  It's a theoretical compound capable of dispersing heat  at high temperatures.  I think Savitar travels so fast  that he needs that suit to neutralize the charge  he builds up around him.  Huh. Interesting.  So without the suit, he's just a dude  with a bad case of static cling.  Yeah. So if we could build a device  capable of harnessing that power,  theoretically, we could use his own velocity against him.  And trap him in the Speed Force.  Tracy, you are indeed a genius.   I'm getting there.  Well, yes, you are.  gasps That means you're gonna stay and help us.  Is that what that means?  If I do, does that mean the future's changing?  I think it means mine certainly has.  light knocking   Hey.  Hey.  Thanks for seeing me. Come on in.  So how are you doing?  Joe, I'm fine. I just  you know, I wish that you would've told me what was going on with you.  Although I obviously have some idea now.  It was my fault that you got caught up in all this.  I'm so sorry, Cecile.  Joe, me too. Look, I  When you told me that you loved me this morning   I froze.  Yeah.  I knew that it meant that we moved up a level  in our relationship.  And for me,  that level comes with a lot of baggage.  Like Killer Frost and The Flash?  Yeah.  So you thought that pushing me away was the thing to do?  I thought that I was protecting you.  Clearly I was wrong,  because not only did I lie to you.  I lied to myself.  And you know what?  I'm done with that.  soft sentimental music    And I'm done with this.  Thank you for not making a big deal  about me wearing this.     Cecile Horton  exhales  I love you.  chuckles  I love you with all my heart.  And I'm sorry that I was dishonest with you.  And from now on,  there will be no secrets   between us.  exhales  both laugh    giggles  sighs, clears throat   Okay.  Mm.  I should have told you a long time ago.  But it's not bad.     Wally!  Hey, Dad.  Hey.  How was it?  It was yeah, it was great. Jesse says hi.   So you talked to Cecile?  I did.  Told her everything.  Told her I love her.  I told her that you were The Flash  and that Wally was Kid Flash.  Don't worry. She promised me   that she wouldn't tell Joanie.  laughter  What changed your mind?  You. All of you.  I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.  Without it, nothing really matters.  Hmm.  And who knows what we'd become  if we didn't have it?   How was Earth3?  Yeah, um,  hanging out with Jesse was awesome.  echoing I mean, love's the only thing we got in this world.  Without it, nothing really matters.  And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?  You did this to me, Barry.   I created you?  I created myself.  You're even gonna create time remnants of yourself,  but he's gonna kill them all.  Savitar told me everything you'd say.  You two are more alike than you realize.  Savitar knows every move you're going to make.  He's always one step ahead of you.  echoing This is all history.  This wasn't just brushing up on days to come.  This was precise.  Like Savitar was there.  Who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?  One step ahead of you.  All history.  I am the future Flash.   One step ahead of you.  distorted Barry?  normally Barry!  Are you okay?  Yeah.  Uh, I'm sorry.  tense music  I'll be I'll be right back, all right?    whoosh    whoosh    I'm here!  panting  I'm here!  whoosh  ominous music    I know who you are.  It's about time.  Yes, it is.  Everything with you is about time, isn't it?  The past, the present, the future  you know all of it, right?  And you know everything about me!  About Joe!  About Wally.  And Iris!  You know our strengths. You know our fears.  You know how much we love each other.  And you know how to use that love against us.  All this time, we thought that we couldn't stop you  because you were one step ahead, but that's not it!  You don't just know what's gonna happen to us.  You were there.  You lived it.  You remember  when you were me.  tense musical flourish  dramatic music    sinister dramatic music  Like I told you from the beginning    I am the future Flash.  dramatic choral music



                    			1 If the answers that we need  to stop Savitar and save you are in the future,  then that's where I need to go.  You're from before she dies, aren't you?  You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.  Just tell me how you did it.  I had help. Her name's Tracy Brown.  She made the Speed Force trap for me.  You're telling me my ideas about the Speed Force   I'm right?  In the future.   We need you to build this trap now.  glass shattering  Caitlin's after Tracy.  That means she's working with Savitar.   So you talked to Cecile?  Told her everything.  Told her I love her. I told her that you're The Flash.  Like I told you from the beginning  I am the future Flash.  dark music  It's like looking in a mirror.  Well not quite.  You're not so scary without your armor.  What can I say?  I outgrew red.  I know what you are.  You're a time remnant.  A temporal duplicate  created when you run back in time  and meet yourself.  You brought a remnant to life last year to defeat Zoom.  Your duplicate died, saving the multiverse,  and you continued your happy little life.  And it would've stayed that way,  but then you decided to play God.  You created Flashpoint and changed everything.  I went to the future.  My future self told me that  he created time remnants to stop you.  But you slaughtered them all.  All but one.  Me.  I lived.  But a funny thing happened  when I did.  You. Joe.  Wally, Cisco.  You all shunned me because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.  I was an aberration.  A disposable hero.  Future you failed to mention that, didn't he?  How did you become Savitar?  I was broken  and alone.  I wanted the pain to end.  And that's when I realized the truth, Barry.  God feels no pain.  All I had to do was become one.  And I only need two more things:  for Iris to die  so that you are driven so far into the dark  that I can be born.  And the other?  It may sound ironic given who I'm talking to,  but I'll keep that one to myself.  What happens if I kill myself?  If I die, then you'll never be created.  Cause and effect's a tricky thing.  Didn't work so well for Eddie, did it?  Shot himself in the chest  Thawne's still kicking around.  See, that's the thing about time travel, Barry.  The more you do it, the less the rules apply to you.  But us having this conversation now  we're changing the future.  Are we?  My ascendancy is nearing.  When I have control of all of time,  it will be you who is abandoned and forgotten.  dramatic music    You're gonna die right here!  I forgot to tell you  my suit's cooler than yours.     It's impossible.  I don't understand. How could Savitar be you?  He's not me. Not really.  He's all the worst parts of you.  It's like in "Star Trek" when the transporter  splits Kirk into good Kirk and bad Kirk.  Please tell me you at least have "Star Trek" on your Earth.   "Voyager."  I hate spinoffs.  That explains why Caitlin was willing to follow him.   He has a face that she trusts.  Half of one anyway.  So when the Legends found that message in the Waverider  from old you saying "Don't trust Barry Allen,"  it was talking about Savitar Barry Allen.  chuckles It's all coming together  in the worst way.  You said you made Savitar?   How?  Peep this.  Four years from now,  future Flash creates  a time remnant to fight Savitar.  But Savitar lets that remnant live  so that it can later become Savitar.  So once Savitar is imprisoned in the Speed Force,  this remnant starts to go crazy.  And he goes back in time to the past  and becomes Savitar.  Creating the lie that he was the first speedster,  spreading the myth and recruiting acolytes throughout the ages.  That doesn't make any sense.  Which came first, Savitar or the time remnant?  It's a closed loop. No beginning, no end.  It's just one endless cycle.  Classic chicken and the egg scenario, I think, eh?  A time remnant, it's, um  it's like a duplicate of you, right?  So it has your feelings, your memories.  So why would he want to hurt us?  Why would he want to kill Iris?  H.R., how's Tracy coming with the Speed Force trap?  Good, yeah, good. Slow.  Get her to speed up, all right?  I'll do that now. Can do.  If Savitar is a version of Barry from the future  and he remembers everything that Barry does,  how are we ever going to come up with a plan to stop him?  What was he like?  Broken.  You know  sighs  all this time I thought that Savitar is this  monster.  It's hard to picture what might happen, and  it being you that  I I know it's not you. I'm  Part of him is.  He said it was like looking in a mirror, and he was right.  But not just the way that he looked.  It was  it was his eyes.  The pain that was inside them.  I've seen that in myself.  When I think about  how my parents died so violently  sometimes I want to repay that violence with more violence.  I want to make someone else  hurt as much as I do.  But you don't ever do that.  You're not him. You're a good person.  But it's in there, you know. That's in me.  That power, that pain,  that's where Savitar comes from. From loss.  From losing you.  You're not going to lose me.  Do you hear me?  And we are going to stop Savitar.   You are not alone. He is.  sighs deeply  And he is not a god.  Jay told me that we're not gods.  He was wrong.  We could be.  Any speedster, and it wouldn't take much.  When the love that we feel in our hearts  is drowned in anger  when the bad memories outweigh the good ones.  What am I going to have to become to stop him?  Hey! Oh, bad time?  No, man, what's up?  I just came up with the best idea ever.  Either that or it's the worst idea ever.   But  It's an idea.  It's an idea!  You want to give me a perm?  It's not for your hair, Steel Magnolia.  This is for your brain, okay?  I want to stop you from making new memories.  What are you talking about?  Savitar knows everything we're gonna do  because he remembers doing it.  He's a future Barry. So  what if Barry can't remember what we're doing now?  You want to mess with his brain?  Just a little bit.  It's a minimal procedure.  It'll still be the same Barry you know and love,  except he just won't be able to retain new information.  There's two types of memory, Allen. Shortterm and longterm.   Longterm is where you  Okay, Julian, just stop.  This is my presentation; I'm the expert here.  This is the part of your brain that retains new information  before sending it to the cortex to be stored forever.  So what if we block that chain  with a magnetic disruption?  So Savitar won't be able to remember  whatever strategy we come up with to defeat him.  Which means he can't be two steps ahead of us anymore.  With any luck, we'll actually put him one step behind.  Beautiful.  Cause and effect.  Barry, what do you think?  Let's do it.  Wait, wasn't Caitlin the expert on brains around here?  She was.  But this is something we'll have to do without her.  I trust you.  You won't feel a thing.  Okay, let's get this show on the road.  The disrupter is attached to your hippocampus.  So, it's ready.  Okay, ready for zapping.  Can we not call it "zapping"?  Ready to activate.  In three  two  one.   Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.  Way to go, slugger.  Run, Barry, run!  I have watched you be in love with Iris  Maybe we were meant to be together.  Okay, that should do it.  All right.  Right. clears throat How do you feel?  I feel fine.   You see? He feels fine.  nervous laughter  Barry  Barry?  Barry.  Who's Barry?  Not fine.  Who are all of you?  What's going on?  Seriously, who are you guys?   Okay, Barry, stay calm.  Who's Barry?   Cisco!  Slight miscalculation.  Slight wouldn't be a word I'd use.  Where the hell am I?  Is this a dentist office?  No, no. This is S.T.A.R. Labs.  St Labs? A laboratory?  St a laboratory? What are you?   Are you guys experimenting on me?  No one is ex  Well, yes, technically, yes.  But but it was consensual.   You were? You  Yes.  Why can't I remember anything?  Why can't I remember my name?  Your name is Barry.  My name's not Barry.  I don't know what my name is, but my name's  "Bartholomew Henry Allen."   That's not a good name.  Look, Barry  Are you sure I don't go by "Bart"? Can  "Bart" feels more natural to me.   Can we go with Bart?  Bart's kinda cool.   Okay.  Wally!  Okay, hey. Let's just get you back in the chair.  No! No, no, no. I'm not   I'm not getting in the chair.  Just get in the chair  No, how do I know you didn't kidnap me here  to do some weird brain surgery on me?  Or maybe you're like those criminals  who trick people into hotel rooms  so they can steal their kidneys.  gasps Do I still have my kidneys?  We don't want your kidneys.  Okay, Barry  look at these photographs.  We're your friends.  Your family.  We just want to help you, okay?  That's a nice ring.  Who's the lucky guy?  You are, Barry.  Look, I know you're scared, okay?  You can trust us.  Cisco.   A minute.  Yes, sir.  I'm gonna be right back, okay?   Wally, stay with him, okay?  Me?  So how do we know each other?  Oh, I'm your brother.  There is no sign of any  permanent structural damage.  Then why can't he remember anything?  Julian?  He appears to be suffering from some sort of   psychogenic retrograde amnesia.   Amnesia.  What if we didn't account for Barry's increase neural velocity,  due to his super speed?  Wait, do we think he knows he's The Flash?  That he has super speed?  Hey, Barry. Catch.  Sorry.  Oh, my Lord.   He's, like, godawful.  He's pathetic.  Can't we flip a switch undo it?  Okay, we are not flipping any more switches   until we figure this thing out.  cell phone vibrates  It's Cecile. Hey, babe.  An emergency?  All right, bye.  Okay, Cecile needs Barry at CCPD,  like, right now. She says it's urgent.  He can't possibly go out in that condition.  Okay, um, my dad and I will take Barry to Cecile.  You and Cisco figure out a way to get Barry's memory back.  And fast.  Yeah?  Okay.  Okay.  You don't want to work?  Well then, I don't need you!  Um, am I to infer then that, uh,  you've hit a little speed bump  in your quest to build a device  to trap Savitar in the Speed Force? The the  Accelerated matter microgenerator projectile.  No, I know. It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.  No, it doesn't.  How about  we call this fancy device of yours   You know, you probably shouldn't   call it the  Speed Force Cannon.  Speed Force Bazooka.  Speed Force Gun.  together Speed Force Bazooka. Is better, yeah.  But if the Speed Force Bazooka doesn't start working soon,  we're gonna have to start calling it  the Speed Force Epic Fail.   Why? What's the problem?  Okay. The accelerometer.  It sucks a hell of a lot of air watts,   which is measured  Alright. Stop talking science!  You need to take a step back  from the Speed Force Bazooka.   There's not time.  There's always time!  Because sometimes, to move forward,  you have to take a step back.  Step back.  You see? Yes.  Shake a little mumbling  Shake out those shoulders. I feel like  Oh, oh, my gosh.  The tension in your shoulders  Think of something that calms you.   Coffee.  Co  Oh, yes.  But not just any coffee.

I'm Barry Allen.   You can call me Bart.  O kay.  So you said there was an emergency. Where's the fire?  Ah, it's funny you should put it like that.   Lucious Coolidge.  Who?   Heat Monger.  The worst arsonist Central City's seen  since Mick Rory went off the grid.  That is, until Flash here stopped him.  What's Flash?  Uh, ah, so what what is the problem?  Judge Hankerson. He's got an opening in his docket,  so he moved Coolidge's probable cause hearing  up to this afternoon.  Barry was the CSI on the case.  So I need him to testify  in order to hold Coolidge over for trial.  Uh, yeah, no.  Barry can't do that.  Why not?  Uh  What do you mean he has amnesia?  Bar, what's her name?  Um Felicia?  Oh, my God.  Is this is this like a  like a Flash thing?  Was he battling a super villain  who used his evil powers to steal Barry's memory?   laughs  Um  no, we sort of accidentally did this  to him ourselves.  Why?  That doesn't matter. What does matter  is you stalling that judge.  Barry is in no condition to testify in court.  Joe, if Barry can't testify,  Coolidge walks.  And then God help us all.  Okay. We'll figure out something.  Please do.  It was nice meeting you.  Oh. Yeah.  You too Bart.  I got some friends down at the courthouse.  I'm gonna go down there and see if we can delay  this whole Coolidge situation, all right?  I'm sorry.  For what?  I don't know. It just seems like everybody's upset  and it feels like it's my fault.  No. No, not at all.  Look, we just want you to get back to normal.  That's it, okay?  Well, I would, if I could remember what normal is.  I mean, what have you and I been doing lately?  Are we planning the wedding?  Like, are we sending out wedding invitations  or picked a honeymoon destination, or  Am I a warm weather guy or a cold weather guy?  Actually, we've been a little busy lately, so  With what?  Um, nothing that you need to worry about, okay?  Okay.

Miss Horton?   Mr. Allen  Can I sit?  Please, just  You are a crime scene investigator  for the Central City police department, correct?  exhales sharply Uh  oh, this is so cool.  Well, I'm so glad you enjoy testifying,  but please just answer the question.  Of course. clears throat  Uh, yes, I am a CSI  at the CCPD under the expert direction of Julian Albert.  Smiley face.  Want to cut it out with the emojis?  Mr. Allen,  can you tell me  in your expert opinion,  what substance do you see in this photograph?  Uh, shellac flakes.  Shellac is a resin secreted by female lac bugs  found in large quantities of the trees in Thailand  that's too fast, that's too  Mr. Allen, are you all right?  Yes, I'm sorry. I'm fine.  I just, um  it's getting hot in here.  What else is unique about shellac flakes?  It's the fire accelerant used in all of the arson cases  associated with Heat Monger.  scoffs Such an embarrassing name.  I like it. I think it's great.  And how would you know when shellac flakes have been used?  We calculate flame temperature and burn patterns,  and a telltale sign is when shellac is burned  into potassium perkerlorate  or ammonium perchlorate,  which is considered a hightemperature accelerant fire.  Hmm. So, then  would you say the fires in these photos  would be considered hightemperature  accelerant fires?  exhales Uh, yes,   because  zap  Ow!  Uhoh.   Um  Mr. Allen?  Can you continue?  Yes, I can I can continue.  The uh, yes, the fires were  hightemperature accelerant fires,  because the flames  were, were  very yellow.  Very yellow?  And that's your expert opinion on accelerant fires?  Mr. Allen?  soft whimper  Ms. Horton, if Mr. Allen is unable to elaborate,  I'll have no choice but to dismiss.  Mr. Allen?  That's um  sighs  Dismissed.  How'd it go?  Marvelous. They let the pyro go.   What went wrong?  Everything.  Barry's memory loss is starting to become a problem.  It sure is.  For more than just him.  I don't have my speed.  Not anymore. And I know why.  If you want to fix this and help Barry,  you are gonna do exactly as I say.  Now this Heat Monger's gonna go free because of me,  and I feel awful.  Barry, it's not your fault.  It's just that now there's a bad guy on the streets,  and I can't do anything about it.  sighs  What? Is that not something I would've said before?  That is exactly something you would've said before.  There's just something about you that always wants to help.  This is our place?  How do we afford to live here?  Wow.  You have great taste.  Uh, actually, this is all you.  I find that hard to believe.  chuckles  Is that me?  Yeah.  Who are these people?  They're your parents.  You don't remember anything  about what happened?  Why, did something bad happen?  They died.  It was unexpected, but they died peacefully.  That's why you came to live with Joe and me.  And that's when we met?  Uh, no, actually, we were friends before then.  I remember the first time that I saw you.  You were the happiest boy that I'd ever met.  I have a feeling that's because you entered my life.  tender music    It's okay.    whirring  What the  Barry! Are you okay?  What just happened to me?!  These powers are so cool.  I can literally feel electricity  coursing through my body.  I mean, is it always like this? This is amazing.  We just walked into a buzzkill.  My presence usually dampens the mood.   Joe, don't.  You fire, I'll fire.  What the hell is she doing here?   She wants to help.  Help?   With what?  With the fact that I lost my powers.  Barry, why don't you give us a minute?  Sure, yeah. Are you like a super villain?  Just asking. Okay.  How did this happen?  You got rid of Barry's memories.  What Barry remembers, Savitar remembers.  So Savitar's lost his memories too?  Savitar loses his memory, he doesn't go along  with the plan to give Wally powers.  Cause and effect.  But if you let me help you figure out  how to get Barry's memories back,  everything goes back to the way it was.   Kid Flash runs again.  And Savitar survives.  And Iris dies.  Life's full of difficult choices.  Or it isn't.  If Savitar gets his memory back, what's in it for you?  That's my business.  You think that Barry can become The Flash?  Yeah. He can learn.  I still know how to do everything. I can teach him.  Okay.  Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.  But there's still a lot of villains in this city,  and no Flashes to protect it.  Is that really a chance you're willing to take?   Hi.  Ah!   I'm still here.  Yeah, you are.  Because when you left, I stayed.  We gotta talk about the elephant in the room.  But you know what, I I have a job to do.  We have to build that device.  We've got to focus on the task at hand.  Do you understand what I'm saying?   I totally understand.  From here on out,  whenever I look into your azure eyes,  flecked with gray, like a summer rainstorm  coming to kiss my lips,  the only thing I'm gonna be thinking about  is how I can best inspire that  beautiful, sexy brain.  tender music    Sparks.  whispering Sparks.  You felt them too.   No.  No?   No, I mean yes, obviously.  Oh, okay.  Sparks. Jumping between two parallel wires  a modified highvoltage climbing arc.  I guess my work here is done.  You should never have tried this without Caitlin.  Well, we didn't really have much of choice, now, did we?  Also, don't refer to yourself in the third person.  It's Caitlin. It's you. It's the same person.  It's just confusing.  Hand me the girard processor.  It'll help me prime his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.  What?  Nothing.  Oh, golly. Look at us.  Just three musketeers working away.  Just like old times, huh?  Hey, Julian, did Caitlin ever tell you about our time  working on the Particle Accelerator with Ronnie?  No. No, she did not.  There was this one time  we had this very strict deadline,  and Dr. Wells was super hard on us.   All of us, even Hartley.  Who's who's Hartley?  Oh, he was this guy we used to work with. Such a dick.  You actually reminded me a lot of him when you first came onboard.  Anyway, so we were working  on the iridium plating for the, um snaps fingers  What was it called again?  The synchrotron, that's what it was.  So anyway, we were struggling,  and we were burning the midnight oil,  and we could not get the dubnium capacitor  to hold a single charge.  And so all of a sudden  Ronnie just loses all his chill.  He turns beet red,  and he starts yelling at the thing like,  "Come on, you dumbnium capacitor!"  "Take charge."  Yes!  laughs Yes.  Oh, my God.  I think about all the memories I cherish most, and  and you're in every single one of them, Caitlin.  Let's figure this out.  I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.  Suit yourself.  Okay!  Guys, I still can't believe I have these powers.  They're amazing.  I mean  I think that I could be a superhero.  laughing  All right, well is it cool if I run some more?   Have at it.  All right.  I haven't seen him this happy in a long time.  Try ever.  It's the first time he hasn't been weighed down  by the tragedies of his past, you know?  First time he's actually been free of them.  You don't want his memory restored, do you?  Dad, I  I can't say that seeing him happy and light  isn't something I have wished for him,  because yeah, it is.  Sweetheart,  I wish that for him, too. But you didn't fall in love with The Flash.  You fell in love with Barry Allen.  Dad, I know this is a different version of him,  but he's  he's still Barry.  No, he's not, honey.  Look, until yesterday,  Barry had 28 years of experiences to define him,  and some of those memories were bad, but some were good, too.  But without those memories,  the Barry Allen we know and love  is gone.  Whoohoo!  I don't know, Dad.  You know, part of me can't help but  think that this is some sort of gift, you know  that this is the life that he was supposed to have.  Maybe the city doesn't need The Flash.  tense music    Hey, everybody!  Happy Friday!  all screaming  So I am a superhero?  Yeah.   A real good one.  Huh.  You're The Flash.  You sure The Streak isn't a better name, maybe?  laughter  Turn on the TV.  Uh, okay. Yeah.  Eyewitnesses say the man who set the fire to the offices  is none other than Lucious Coolidge, AKA Heat Monger.  That's the guy that went free because of me.  At this rate, it won't be long before the whole thing burns down.  There's hundreds of people who work in there.  We need to stop it.  How? I mean, you can't right now.  No, but I can.  Barry, you don't know how to use your powers.   Bar  You just said I'm a superhero.  And a good one, right?  I mean, memories or not I can't stand by,  and watch people die if I can prevent it.  Um, forgot the suit.  dramatic music    grunts  Barry? You okay?  Uh, yeah, I'm good.  Stopping's hard.  How do I save everybody inside?  You just run them out of there.  I barely got here myself.  How am I supposed to run with someone else?  There's gotta be something we can do.  There is something we can do:  jumpstart his brain using that thing.  We have not done a test run.   There's no time to test it now.  What is that thing?  This can send electrical charges through the transmitters in his suit  and theoretically, should jolt his memory.  You want to electroshock his brain?  Won't that fry it even more?  If we don't do that, all those people are gonna die.  Life's a game of chance.  Okay, Barry, you're gonna feel something.  Might hurt, might sting, might suck.   Wait, what?  Probably all three.  Okay, here we go.  screaming  moans  Barry?  grunts  Barry?  Uh, yeah, I still don't remember.  Why didn't that work? That was supposed to work.  We kickstarted his temporal lobe.  Now he just needs to access it.  Gas is in the tank, we just need to turn the ignition.  We need a visceral memory to spark his brain.  woman screaming  Okay  okay.  Barry?  I need you to remember.   I can't!  Yes, yes, you can. Okay?  Okay, listen to me.  The night that your mom died,  I didn't want to tell you how,  but she didn't die peacefully.   She was murdered.  What?  And you came to live with us.  My dad brought you inside, and  you were in shock you weren't even crying.  And later that night, a sound woke me,  and I crawled out of my bed,  and I realized that the sound was coming from downstairs.  I peered over the banister, and  I found you crying alone.  I knew I had to go to you.  I sat next to you, and  you put your head in my lap,  and I held you while you cried.  And I didn't know it then, but now looking back,  I realize that that was the night that we fell in love.  That was the night that we realized  how much we needed each other.  And look  I so wish  that I could take your dark memories away.  I wish  that I could make all of that pain go away,  but I can't.  Okay? But what I do know, what I know,  is that for every bad memory,  there is a good one  that will get you through it.  soft dramatic music    Run, Barry, run!    Barry?  I remember  I remember.  I remember everything.  I remember everything!  Now for this fire.  exciting music  I don't think I can put this fire out alone.  You don't have to.    Yes!  laughs  panting  Looks like you remembered how to save the day.  Like riding a bike.   Your mother's maiden name.  Thompson.  CODIS is an acronym for what?  Combined DNA Index System.  Okay.  In the third grade, you renamed the class hamster to  chuckles  Alexander Ham Bell.  laughter  I was eight years old.  So you got your memories back.  Now we can all focus our attention on  stopping Savitar.  scoffs  Good luck with that.  Please tell me we're not gonna just let her walk out of here.   Now you want to fight?  We don't want to fight you.  Can't really avoid that now, can we?  Yeah, we can. You can stay here with us.  We're your friends. Your family.  Caitlin, I can fix you.  You already tried.  Well then, I'll try harder.  I don't care what it takes.  I don't care what I have to do.  I swear to you, I will find you a cure.  Caitlin, I love you.  I don't love you, Julian.  I never did.  I never loved any of you.  somber music    She's gone?  Yeah.  Maybe too far gone now.  We'll figure out a way to get her back.  Just like we figured out how to get you back.  You sure this is the me you want?  With all the baggage?  Seeing you without the weight of everything that's happened,  seeing you happy, like you were before your mother was killed?  Without all of that darkness haunting you,  you were finally free.  It was nice.  I did the same thing months ago.  What do you mean?  That freedom? I had that.  When I was with my mom and dad again in Flashpoint,  and I could've let it stay like that.  I could've let the memories of this timeline fade, but  if I'd done that, I would've lost Joe,  and Cisco, and Wally, and Caitlin, and you.  Pain and darkness it's a part of me.  You know, I need it to fuel me,  to push me to be a better person,  to be a better hero.  To keep me from ever forgetting who I am.  Now that  is the Barry Allen I know and love.  warm music    Hey, you guys okay!  You guys, you got to come see this.  Yyou got to come see this.  What is that?  This is the Speed Force Bazooka.   Good, right?  And that's gonna trap Savitar?  There is a tiny little problem.   What's that?  It's, uh  In order to generate enough power  to magnetize Savitar's radial field  and keep him in a state of perpetual stasis   Stasis.   inside the Speed Force,   we need by my calculations  By calculations  3.86 terajoules of energy.  I'm guessing that's more energy than in a AAA battery.  Yes. That's more energy than in the sun.  Guys, where are we gonna find something like that?  dramatic music    roars1 Four years from now,  Dr. Brand invents the technology  that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.  This is the Speed Force bazooka.  And that's gonna trap Savitar?  I know what you are.  You're a time remnant.  You all shunned me  because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.  I was an aberration.  How did you become Savitar?  I was broken and alone.  God feels no pain.  All I had to do was become one.  Aurora's "Murder Song"  melancholy acoustic music    Five, four, three two, one   Five, four, three, two, one   He holds   The gun   Against my head     I close   My eyes   And bang   I am dead   I know he knows   That he's killing me for mercy     And here I go    Go   Oh, oh, ohoh,  Oh, oh, ohoh   Oh, oh, ohoh   exhales  Iris.  You know what I'd love right now?  Anything you want.  Caviar.  sad music   Caviar?  Mmhmm.  Okay.

Yeah, I love the breeze   Yeah. Yeah.   on days like this.  So, I got your message.  But, you're gonna have to run me through   exactly what you need again.  Yeah   So, we're building a cannon  Right.   bazooka thing. It's a sort of trap.  In order to turn it on, we need something to power it.  Something extremely powerful and regenerative.   Okay.  Yeah, so,  I tasked our satellite to look for  anything that might have our specific power requirements,  and wouldn't you know it  we found something that has exactly what we need.  laughs And it's right there in that building.  Crazy, huh?  I really don't think you should be spying on me, Cisco.  Is it spying if we're friends?  But he's right, isn't he? You have something, don't you?  It's a piece of the Dominators' technology.  We got it from the ship that crashed in Central City.   That's great.  You can't have it, Barry.   What?  Lyla  we've searched everywhere.  This tech is the only thing that we can use.  I can't do it.  Is this because of baby Sara?  Look I'll admit, it's been hard not to wonder  what it would have been like to have a daughter instead of a son,  but this is less about what happened  than why it happened.  I made a big mistake.  Exactly my concern.  Barry, this is the kind of tech that wars are fought over.  If something happens and it gets into the wrong hands,  people could die. Millions.  And frankly, I don't know if I can trust you to have it.  Director Michaels.  I gotta go.  Lyla, if we don't use this,  Iris is going to die.  Tonight.  I'm sorry, Barry.  I can't help you this time.  You'll have to find another way.  melancholy music     Are you serious?  Yeah.  Yeah, if Lyla won't let us have the Dominators' tech,  then we are gonna break into ARGUS, and we're gonna steal it.  Wally and I will phase through the walls.  We'll be in and out of there before anyone even gets off a shot.  Uh, hello? No, you won't.   Yeah, we  What is that?  That is a metahuman power dampener.  And it's all over the building, so you can't use your powers inside.  Can we use anything else  to power this Speed Force gun?   Speed Force bazooka.  Bazooka.  Nothing else.  Manipulating extradimensional energy requires,  well, a ridiculous of energy,  and the Dominator tech's the only thing that can do that.  Hey, I have I have an idea, gang.  What if we just put you   put Iris on a plane to Paris  No.   or somewhere far away?  There's nowhere on Earth that Savitar wouldn't find her.  Guys. Stealing this Dominators' tech is our only option, all right?  Barry. ARGUS is more secure than the pentagon.  If your powers don't work in there,  how are you gonna get past security?  Okay. inhales deeply  This is what we're dealing with:   surveillance cameras.  I'm out.   Eye scans.  Nope!   Palm prints. Heat sensors.  Whoa!   What?  Laser sensors.  They really thought of everything, didn't they?  That's just the first floor.  So, you're saying this is the most fortified structure  in the history of fortified structures,  they can't use their superpowers,  and we have less than 14 hours to steal the thing.  And none of us are master thieves.  No.  No, we're not.    intense music    gun charges  Hello, Flash.    I need your help.  Barry Allen.

I'm up to my fuzzy hood in teamwork.  Would it help if I said please?  No. And you already have a bunch  of superhero types in your life.  Why ask me?  Well, you have a  particular set of skills.  Great movie. Last time we tried to be buddybuddy,  it didn't work out so well  for you.  Why trust me now?  Spit it out, or I'm gonna step onto that ship  and pretend like this conversation never happened.  Iris.   Oy. The girlfriend.  FiancÃ©e.  Mazel tov.  What about her?  If you don't help me, she's gonna die.  True love.  That's your pitch.  It's all I've got.  And I assume saving your girlfriend  requires us doing something  less than lawful?  We need to break into ARGUS and steal an alien power source.  The Flash, a thief?  That's my kind of mission. One condition:  my rules.  Your rules.  I know we don't have a plane.  We steal a plane, okay? We'll put it back.

Right?  sighs Look, I'm not changing time.  I will put him back,  right where I found him. After we get what we need.  Fine.

For what?  Oh  it doesn't matter.   Well, should I stop them?  No.  Let them take it.  No speed gun can stop a god.  My guess is the power source is most likely here.  Why there?  Because it's the deepest part of the facility,  and if it's as valuable as you say it is,  then the deepest recesses of any facility  are usually the most secure.  Hm. Smart, Snart.   chuckles "Smart, Snart."  Mmhmm.  I'm gonna keep hackin' away and find out for sure.  exhales  Do you have any idea what else might be down there?  Don't matter.

I I can't believe that.   Is Tracy all right?  Not good.  She just wants to be alone.  There'll be time to mourn.  Right now, we need to figure out our next move.  So for the millionth time,  I'm lost on all this time travel stuff.  What happens now? With Savitar?  Iris didn't die. So that changes things, right?  I mean, since Iris didn't die,  future me never goes down that same dark path.  I never create time remnants to fight Savitar.  And if future you never creates these time remnants,  then Savitar himself is never born.  Precisely. Once the time paradox  catches up with him, then inhales  he'll be erased from existence.  But I saw him. He didn't disappear.   Not yet.  But he will, Joe.  Any guesses how long that's gonna take?  Maybe a few hours?  He can do a lot of damage in a few hours.  Well, guys, we can't just sit around  and wait for Savitar to disappear.  But Savitar won't become Savitar if he's erased.  Not unless he pulls off  whatever he's got in mind, before the paradox hits him.   He stole the bazooka for a reason.  Yeah, why?  I don't know, but remember,  he's been planning this for centuries.  He wants to be a god.  He must need the bazooka,  and Caitlin, to achieve his goals.  Anybody got any good news?  Actually, uh, voilÃ .   What is that?  This, Detective,  is the cure for Caitlin.  You're kidding. You figured it out?  Not by myself. With the help of  Caitlin's mother.  This is experimental gene therapy.  This? This will rewrite Caitlin's metaDNA.  This will bring back  Caitlin. chuckles  whoosh I searched the forest.  Savitar and Caitlin were gone.  So was Cisco.  Savitar has 'em both.  crashing  Cisco laughs  Oh, you better have a plan B,  'cause I don't think your plan A worked out too well.  Fix this.  Fix what? The Speed Force bazooka?  Hey, I didn't name it.  If I didn't name it, I didn't make it.  And if I didn't make it,  I don't know how it works.  Oh, you know enough about it to alter what it does.  Oh, I see. You want me to alter it.  Well, what do you want me to alter it into?  Like, a hair dryer? Or a waffle maker?  Oh, I know. Maybe something that's gonna  fix that thincrust pizza you call a face.  An intradimensional quantum splicer.  dramatic music  A splicer.  I do have a plan B.  I open a time portal, exposing the Speed Force,  you shoot me with that, and I become fragmented  throughout all of time.  The past, present, future.  After that, the paradox can't reach me.  You wanna splice yourself throughout time?  Exist in every single moment there ever was?  All of us aware and connected  through one consciousness.  I'll be everywhere every hour, every minute.  And then,  I will rule from the Big Bang until the end of the world.  You wanted us to build this thing.  Well, why do you think I let you idiots live?  Tracy Brand trapped me in the Speed Force in the future.  All I had to do was get her to build this a little earlier  and have my best friend make all the adjustments.  I'm not your friend.  Get  to work, Francesco.  How about I sit on my ass  and let you obliterate permanently from existence?  How's that sound?  hand fluttering  That's your plan?  Do it or you'll ReverseFlash me?  Not you.  whispering Her.  sighs  sharp ringing  You know what I'm remembering?  Julian just got back to S.T.A.R Labs.  He has the cure.  He can turn her back.  You can have her back. You're so close.  But not if she's dead.  So put that mechanical genius to good work.  Make me what I need.  And I will let you both go.  intense music  pensive music    I hated Thawne  and Zoom.  They took so much from me.  And I've hated Savitar  for threatening to take you away from me too.  But he didn't.  I know.  There is strength in anger.  I've used it before.  And so we sit here, with our anger,  trying to think of a way to hurt Savitar  or maybe kill him.  And I just don't think that hate's gonna get it done this time.  What do you mean?  Something that Snart said to me  that the Flash should stay a hero, all the way,  and sometimes that it's not about who can punch the hardest  or run the fastest.    So what are you gonna do?  The last thing he'd expect.    low ominous music    whoosh    I wasn't sure you'd come.  Must be an odd sensation,  getting new memories.  You having an uncertain future.  What do you want? I'm busy.  chuckling Doing what?  Getting erased from existence?  We will see which one of us gets erased.  Are you still planning on becoming a god?  Cisco and Caitlin are still alive.  If that's what you're worried about.  Oh, I know. You need them, right?  To pull off your grand ascension.  Look, Barry,  if I wanted to talk to myself,  I could have done that, back at my lair.  What do you want?  I wanna help you.   Really?  You don't have much time  before the paradox reaches you.  Come back to S.T.A.R Labs.  Let Cisco and Caitlin go,  and let us figure out a way to save you.  You really think I'd trust you?  You showed up.  So you remember me coming here.  Did I have any tricks up my sleeve?  Was I was I planning on blindsiding you?  I don't know, Barry.  Maybe I get off on watching you grovel.  No, I don't think that's it. I think you're hearing me.  I'm still in there.  Deep down, buried beneath the scars and the pain,  that part of you that it must feel so lonely.  But it also knows what it's like to have a family,  to have friends.  You can have all that back.  We can stop hurting each other.  I remember when I was six, and, uh  I begged Mom and Dad  to let me go to the Science Expo in Midway.  And, uh, well, we got a flat tire on that dirt road, no spare,  so we were towed to that garage in a tiny, onestreet town.  Of course, we were stuck there all day.  Then we got ice cream  and French fries with gravy  at that little diner.  And then that night, we watched  the local fireworks show, and  Actually, it turned out to be a great day.  And it's my favorite memory of Mom and Dad.  What was the name of that town?  Masonville.  I'm still in there.  Come home.  suspenseful music  soft music    tense music    You make a move toward Iris  He won't.

Okay?  I will be here for you.  I tried to kill you.  I killed H.R.  And you are going to have to live with that.  But we won't give up on you, okay?  That is not what we do.  There is a way through this for all of us.  hopeful music  Where are Cisco and Caitlin?    I'll bring them home.  sighs  whooshing  alarms chirping  dramatic music  What is it?  There's energy radiating from the breach room.  And it's not breach energy.  It's the philosopher's stone.  It's releasing all its energy.  Savitar.  It looks like it's gonna blow.  rapid beeping  Wally.

I think we were pretty close.  I'm sorry, "we"?  Where have you been the last six months again?   She was only trying to help.  Look, guys,  we need to concentrate on stopping this Samurai  who's trying to destroy the city, not on Barry.   Dude, what is your deal?  (PHONE RINGING)  It's like you don't even want him back.  Hey, hey, hey!  Cecile, can I call you back in a minute?  We're in the middle of something here.  What?  State police picked him up on the 112   outside of Ivy City.  That's 300 miles away.  Yeah, one of the cops is a Keystone vet.   Recognized him.  I knew it would work.  I knew it.  You should prepare yourselves.  (SOLEMN MUSIC)    (SOFT MUSIC)  Barry?    Barry    Nora shouldn't be here.  Your mom isn't here, Barry. It's  it's me, Iris.  You're home.  Your Honor, I'm innocent.  I didn't do this. I didn't kill anyone.  Can you hear the stars singing?  Rhyming, chiming, timing every hour, every minute.  You said the city was safe,  that there was no residual danger,  but that's not true.  What really happened that night  The city is safe.  You saved it. You saved us all.  (SOLEMN MUSIC)    Stars melting  like ice cream,  dream, gleam. (GROANS)  Nothing seems  Nora shouldn't be here.  I'm guessing this isn't just shock.  Shock results from a drop in blood pressure.  This is neurological.  It's a whole new way of looking at physics.  It will change the way that we think  about everything,  from a single atom  to an entire galaxy.  God!  (GROANS) Stars so loud.  Loud, cloud, proud.  (TENSE MUSIC)  Dad and I are both okay.  We're gonna be fine.  I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.    We need to get him back to S.T.A.R. Labs now.    (EXHALES SHARPLY) (SYRINGE HISSES)  What's the diagnosis?  Does he have brain damage or something?  He's actually scary healthy.  His neurotransmitters are functioning at  five times the normal speed.   Then what's wrong?  I have two theories.  One is that he's suffering from a form of schizophasia.  That's where you assign the wrong definitions to words.  So, from his perspective,  all that nonsense he's saying makes sense?  It's too bad we don't have a translator.  No, but we can make one.  If his brain's schizophastic  and these symbols represent different words,  he could be sending us a message,  and we just need the right algorithm to decrypt it.  You said you had two theories. What's the other one?  We know that the Speed Force exists beyond space and time.  To us, Barry was only in there for six months,  but to him, it could've been 10,000 years.  (SOLEMN MUSIC)  All that time in isolation,  it could've caused dementia.  That may be all of him that's left.  So how do we find out which one it is?  I could decrease the sedative, wake him up.  I think I've got the perfect song for that.  (LADY GAGA'S "POKER FACE" PLAYING)  Are you sure this is appropriate?  Yeah. It's a good luck charm.  I mean, it worked before.  Last time, he was in a coma,  not a pantemporal extra dimension.  Well, waking up to Gaga shouldn't seem too freaky.  Hey, Barry.  Hey.  It's me, Cisco,  AKA Vibe,  BKA your BFF.  Yeah.

Now.  That is the same weird code from the elevator murder scene.   Wait, doesn't that mean  Our hacker's got a hit list.  Wa can you crack it?  Man, I've been trying to crack this code all day.  It looks like a virus.  Well, yeah, because it's a computer virus.  No, no, no. Scooch.  Oh. I feel violated.  digital beeping  It looks like an organic virus.  But with a digital subbase.  Our killer isn't just hacking machines.  He's controlling them.  Our hacker's not a hacker.  He's a meta.  Is there any connection between the two victims?  There's nothing online.  But their names Weaver, Kwon They sound very familiar to me.  I started collecting these tech magazines in high school.   They were like  Those are the magazines  you collected in high school?  laughing Okay. That's that's hurtful.  That's really hurtful. Anyway.  I'm 90% sure that's where I read those names.  Okay, great. Start digging.  Barry, can I talk to you for a second?  Mmhmm.  Hey, about what happened I am sorry.  I should've listened to you, it's just,  sometimes when I'm out there, things move so fast  and I'm really excited to be the Flash again.  Anyway, I hope you're not mad.  And you are. You're mad, aren't you?  No, no. I'm not mad.  I just think with With us being engaged  and now we're working together,  that it's more important than ever that we communicate.  I completely agree.  Good, because Caitlin mentioned something earlier  and I sort of dismissed it, but now I'm  I'm really thinking that it could help us.  What is it?  Couples therapy.  Couples therapy?   Mmhmm.  You  We're not, like, in trouble, are we?  No, no. No, of course not.  I just think that any couple  that's doing everything we're doing could  use some advice.  Mmhmm.  We're just talking about a tune up, I mean, there's  There's nothing wrong with that, right?  A tune up? Right, yeah, no, I mean,  if it's sure, if it's what you wanna do,   then sure, yeah, let's try it.  Great.  'Cause we've got an appointment in 30 minutes.  I'll get my purse.  What?  inquisitive music    whispers Later.  door opens   Hi. Iris?  Hi.   Barry?  Hello.  Hi, I'm Doctor Sharon Finkel.  I am so sorry I kept you waiting.  Oh, no, no. It's fine.  Thank you for squeezing us in.  Oh, well, you made it sound so urgent on the phone.  nervous laughter No.  No, not urgent.  I'm excited to dive in.  Right?  Oh, absolutely. I love therapy.  Oh. Have you been before?  Just once, when I was a kid,  after my mom died.  Oh, your mom. Oh.  pen clicks  But I'm okay with that.  I mean, I'm not okay with it, obviously.  I mean, I'd prefer that she was alive.  I just meant that I've already dealt with it is  I don't think it's worth writing down.  These notes are just for me.  No one is judging you guys.  Yes, we know. laughs  Oh, my dad died too. sheepish laugh  Just for your notes. mutters  So, Barry, Iris filled me in a little bit  about the two of you on the phone before.   Getting married?  Yeah. giggles  Yeah, it's been a long road getting here.   Mmhmm.  First, um  us growing up together, and then, um,  I was engaged to someone else.  Oh, okay.  That's worth a writedown?  He's actually dead too. sheepish laugh  Oh, you two have had to deal with a lot of trauma.   Well  No, not a   Eddie and Ronnie.  I mean, a little.   My mom. H.R.  Not too much.   Laurel.  Some.   Snart.  mutters We've been   to a few funerals.  Yeah.  So, Barry,  why do you think Iris wanted you two to see me tmeay?  Well, Iris and I  We recently started working together.  You see, I went away for a while on a, uh   A business trip.  Business trip.  For six months and y Um, I guess now yeah.  We're just learning to get back in sync,  to sync up again.   Is that right?  Mmhmm.  Well, there's no right or wrong, Barry.  Right.  I think we could work on listening a little bit more.   Right?  Uhhuh, yeah.  Um, or else, someone could get really hurt.  You know, like, if they crashed their car  into a brick wall going 100 miles per hour.  nervous laugh She means that emotionally.  mutters Do I?  Hello, mamacita.  They don't make them like you anymore.  What the hell?  Easy, it's just the Motherboard of the Month,  July of '07, okay? Look at her. growls  Kinda wish it was a girl.  Baby, it's been hours.  You guys haven't made any progress yet?  No mention of Kurt Weaver or Tim Kwon  or any connection between the two of them.  Until now. Got him.  Take note, people, it's only hoarding if it doesn't pay off.  Okay, so that's Tim Kwon.  That's Kurt Weaver. That's Sheila Agnani.  Who's that guy?  Ooh, sorry about that.  No, it's definitely my fault.  ominous music    robot whirrs    You don't have any idea who would wanna do you harm?  Not even a gut feeling?  No, I mean, everyone loves a billionaire, right?  No, I have no idea.  robot whirring  Grenade! Everybody move!  people shouting    So, what would you say your goals are for this session?  Uh, well, I just want to know that Barry hears my concerns  about our issues with miscommunication.  Uh, I gotta go.  You gotta go?  He's gotta go.   Yeah sorry, um  Mm.  This was sorry.  You're gonna write down that he ran out of here, aren't you?  Yes.    whirring  clattering  Get down!  heroic music    both grunting, panting  Everybody okay?  I don't know. Must've been a dud.  Same corrupted code. Same guy.  Someone very creatively  tried to kill Tim Kwon and Kurt Weaver.  Where's Kwon now?  He ran out of here scared out of his mind.  He wouldn't even wait for a protected escort.  But the good news is,  I found a connection between our victims.  Four years ago, Kurt Weaver and Tim Kwon created an app  in their garage with two other programmers.  Some kind of malware called Kilgore.  And then they sold it off to a big tech company.  So that's how they made their money.  I saw this guy. He was here.  Ramsey Deacon. Looks like we found our meta.  And for some reason he's going after his old partners.  It's like "Silicon Valley" if Richard went nuts  and started killing everyone at Pied Piper.  I feel like he's got more of a anarchist Gilfoyle vibe.  Erlich, maybe.  Look, guys, I love that we are so confident  in our ability to apprehend villains  that we can have this debate, but, hi.   What about her?  That's Sheila Agnani.  She's, like, a big deal tech guru now.  She could be next on Deacon's list.  We'll definitely have to protect her.  Yeah, well, my dad and Wally can do that, right?   I'm on it.  Great.  I'll keep working on the code.   Sure.  Sorry about therapy.  Oh, it's okay. I told Dr. Finkel  that you had a work emergency.  True. Kind of.  Yeah, and she had a cancellation this afternoon,  so we should get over there.   Don't wanna be late.  No yeah.  muttering Let's get back in there  This guy is a living computer virus.   That's a new one.  Look at this code.  From the elevator, to the car,  to the bomb robot, this code keeps changing  grumbles But I can't figure out why.  Okay, we have to remember that it's not just digital.  It's biodigital.  Most organic viruses mutate to avoid being killed.  So, if we managed to create digital antibodies,  then we can shut this guy down.   Oh, nice one!  Mmm.   Hi.  Hi.  sheepish laugh I'm so glad you're here,  'cause I truly, deeply, from the bottom of my heart  I am sorry, but I'm gonna have to cancel our date.  If you're gonna vibe blast me, can I at least pick the spot?  It's fine, Cisco.   I get it.  You get it?  Yeah, what's not to get? You have to work, so  we will cancel our date.  Well, good luck, you guys. I hope it works out.  quirky music    What a cool chick.  laughs She took that so well.  No. No, she didn't.  When a girl says she gets it,  what she really means is she doesn't get it at all.  I'm confused.  Don't be. Very simple.  You, my friend, are in so much trouble.  You just had to fall for the girl  in headtotoe black leather, didn't you?  We're back.  That was quick, even for me.  both laugh softly   mutters  Inside joke so, yes.  Work emergency aside,  I have a sneaking suspicion  that you'd rather be somewhere else, Barry.  No, no. I um  I mean, we do have a  big work thing that we're dealing with.  It's important.  Yeah, but so is this.  You know, if we're not on the same page, Barry,  people could die.   Uh  Metaphorically.  No. No, no.  Don't hold back.  Turn to Iris, look her in the eyes,  and tell her what you wanted to say.  I don't know Uh, well  I  I said I was sorry about this morning.  sighs  Iris.  Turn to Barry. Talk to him.  It's not just this morning, Barry.  You cancelled training  the other day without asking me.  Training?   Swimming.  For a marathon.   It's a triathlon.  Mmhmm.  Anyway, I didn't think cancelling training  was that big of a deal.  Yeah, but you made all those wedding plans too  and you didn't consult me.  I was trying to be a good fiancÃ©.  Yeah, but I'd think most brides would be happy  that their future spouse cared about helping with the wedding.  That is a good thing, right?  Look, I don't know. I mean, I guess  our wires have gotten crossed a few times the last few days,  but I think that hardly rises to the level of a crisis.  After everything we've been through together,  you and me, we're Barry and Iris.  We're the gold standard.   I am so in love  Then how could you leave me?  solemn music  You left me, Barry. You just left me.  Standing there, alone.    How could you do that?    energetic punk music playing    All the listening devices are in place.  Keep your ears open.  Gotta make sure she's safe.  punk music playing   Yeah.  laughs  What?

Let it go, Tim.   We are not happening.  Sheila, listen.  Deacon's coming for us.  He wants payback for what we did to him.  What did we do to him?  Kurt scrubbed any connection between us from the net,  so as far as the world's concerned, we're innocent.  But we're not.  I should've never let you talk me  into going along with this.  And now Kurt's dead.  Deacon killed him.  He did not.  Oh, yes. He did.  ominous music    punk music playing  Oh, this is a nice house.  How much do you pay for it? 10 mil?  Let's talk about this. We can make it right.  Shut up, Tim.  You could've had all this too.  This is could've been yours.  Kilgore was my idea.  And you three stole it away from me.  Somebody had to.  Otherwise, it would've just been a halfway clever idea  that died in someone's garage.  Sheila.  No, I'm not going to apologize  because after four years,  you finally found some balls.  I found something else.  Something I never had with my family,  or at MIT, or with any of you.  Really? And what was that?  Power.  mechanical whirring  Oh, you're not still diabetic, are you?    gasping  Those new computercontrolled insulin pumps   are a real life saver.  wheezing  Way too much insulin Well, that can be lethal.  wheezing  How should we kill you?  gasping for breath  digital beeping  strenuous wheezing  wheezing  He put her in insulin shock.    Glucose.  wheezing    breathing stabilizes  gasping Deacon took him.  He took Tim.  No sign of Deacon or Kwon on facial recognition,  traffic cameras nothing.  We don't even know if Kwon's still alive.  We gotta move fast.  Where were you two?   Dry cleaners.  Wedding cleaners.  Dry cleaners.  Um, Cisco?  Uh, where are you with those biodigital antibodies?  I'm nowhere.  Actually, no You know what?  I am somewhere.

I'll go talk to him.  light music    Has everybody lost their minds?  laughing  She must think I'm blowing her off.  But I'm just trying to do my job.  I guess the word "reschedule" doesn't exist on Earth 19.  Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that  the reason you can't focus on the science is because  you're so worried about what's going on with Gypsy.  I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything you said.  But II think I figured it out.  I think I can't focus on anything  'cause of this whole Gypsy situation.  I'm I think I'm just gonna have to talk to her.  What a great idea.  Hey.  What's up, Cisco?  You're mad at me.  I said it was fine.  No, no, no.  Rule number one, when a girl says it's fine, it's not fine.  Amen!  I'm gonna go.  Rule number two, you don't blow off a date  with your favorite person.  The day got away from me. Let me make it up to you, okay?  Date night tomorrow?  No, Cisco. It it had to be today.  Why today?  Because today is OneOneOne Day.  Onewhatwhatwhat?  It's OneOneOne Day.  What is that?  OneOneOne Day on my Earth is  is the day that you celebrate with the one  with the one you love, all right?  It's when one soul, plus one soul, equals  one soul.  That is so sappy.  Yes, it is sappy.  And it is stupid and schmoopy.  But there is something about you that  It makes me wanna do stupid, schmoopy things.  And I hate the word "schmoop" and people who use it.  Well, that is the sweetest and angriest thing  you've ever said to me.  Why didn't you just tell me that?  Because I was embarrassed, Cisco.  So, you know what? Let's just forget about it.  Because the day is already over and I would really like  to forget that I ever brought this up  No, no, no.  I will not forget it, okay?  You are important to me.  And if OneOneOne Day is important to you  OneOneOne.  laughs That's it.  I gotta go.  stammering It's like he doesn't know  that he's a dead man.  Hey.  I don't know why I thought that we didn't have  to talk about what happened.  You were so happy I was back.  I am happy.  You're everything to me.  Look  I had to explain to our friends and family  why they had a savethedate for our wedding  but no invitation.  I had to constantly lie about why you were gone.  solemn music  You don't know the looks people gave me  because they knew that wasn't the truth.  You know, what they must've thought about us.  What it made me think about us.  Iris  sighs  It's not like I wanted to leave you.  I had to put on a brave face for everyone,  but it was killing me inside.  And I think part of why I didn't talk it through  with you is I was afraid.  I was afraid that you would tell me to stay.  And I wouldn't have been strong enough not to.  Barry, how do you know what I'm gonna say  if you don't ask me?  I am here to help you.  Especially when everything seems lost.  But you have to let me.  But sometimes it's not about us, or the team.  Sometimes the weight of the whole city  falls on my shoulders, and it's up to me to carry it.  I'm the Flash.  See, that's what you don't get.  When I put this ring on my finger,  it wasn't just about you or me anymore.  It was about us.  You are not the Flash, Barry.  We are.   computer beeps  Guys.  We need you. It's about Deacon.  sighs  I have something to confess.  Kurt Weaver, Sheila Agnani, and I  We stole the Kilgore malware program from Ramsey Deacon.  We sold it for billions.  But it was all his idea.  We got rich. And he got nothing.  I guess that explains why Deacon's got such a vendetta.  Cisco, if he's livestreaming, can you track the signal?  In, like, two seconds.  Papa loves having his own satellite.  What are you gonna do when you find him?   Hit him with this.  What is that?  Deacon's powers are derived  from the binary code in his DNA.  So, we created a compound encoded  with a numerical string pattern of ones and zeros  to invert the order of the code.  Ones become zeros, and vice versa.  One plus one plus one.  All right, we're on it.  Send us the location once you have it.   Okay.  Let's do it.  tense music  And now you know the truth.  We stole Kilgore from Ramsey Deacon.  He is the real victim.  Good.  You forgot one thing.  What?  You didn't say goodbye to anyone who's gonna miss you.    You ever play wishbone, Tim?  screaming  metal clanking  He and the others destroyed my life!  Listen, I know you feel wronged, Deacon,  but that doesn't give you a right to take his life.  I smell technology in your suit.  What have you got in there?  Oh, crap.  mechanical whirring  gasping  I can't move.  Weapon system online.  Targeting.   beeping  Run.  groaning  gasping  Call me Kilgore.  Barry?

Not even a lightbulb.  There's technology everywhere these days.  That's fine, we just have one question for you.  That particle accelerator explosion four years ago  You were living in Silicon Valley.  So, if you weren't here that night,  how did you get your powers?  laughing Oh, wow.  Oh, you're not gonna believe it.  It really was something, though.  A real life changer.  And do you two wanna know the best part?  I wasn't the only one.  So, good luck, gentlemen.  Think Central City's about to have its hands full.  tense music    Thank you for letting us see the prisoner, Warden Wolfe.  Oh, my pleasure. Did you get what you needed?   We think so.  Well, not to worry.  This socalled Kilgore isn't going anywhere.  We'll take good care of him.  How is it possible that Deacon's a meta  if he didn't get his powers  from Wells' particle accelerator blowing up?  However it happened, we will figure it out,  and we will be ready.  After Cisco gets all that tech out of your suit.  You don't need fancy gadgets to be the Flash.   You are the Flash.  No.   We are.  Hm.  Did I miss something?    soft piano music    Ah, one of my childhood favorites.  Schubert's "Unfinished Eighth Symphony."  Unfinished until now.  You didn't.  It was surprisingly simple to extrapolate  the remaining movements once I familiarized myself  with the body of his work.  All 600 of his works?  I woke up early this morning.  chair whirring  Do you have an update?  Subject One has been located.  He's safe.  Locked up in the metahuman wing  at Iron Heights as we speak.  He's right where you wanted him.  What do we do now?  Now we find the others.My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. And one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. That day is today. What? No Big Belly Burger? It's one of the few perks of living in this time. We're out of cows where I come from. You don't care about that. You have questions. Go ahead. Not sure where to start Thawne. That is your real name Eobard Thawne.  Since the day I was born.  And when was that? That's not what you want to know. Go ahead, Barry. Ask it. Why did you kill my mother? Because I hate you. Not you now. You years from now.  In the future.  In a future. Yes. We're enemies, rivals, opposites, reverses of one another. Why? Whwhy were we enemies? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter anymore. What matters is that neither of us was strong enough to defeat the other. Until I learned your secret. I learned your name. Barry Allen. And finally, I knew how to defeat you once and for all. Travel back in time, kill you as a child. Wipe you from the face of the earth. But then you, future you, that is, followed me back, and we fought. We both landed some pretty solid shots. And then you, future you, got your younger self out of there. I was so mad. But then I thought what if you were to suffer a tragedy? What if you were to suffer something so horrible, so traumatic that your child self could never recover? Then you would not become The Flash. And so I stabbed your mother in the heart, and I was free. Finally able to return to a future without The Flash, only to realize that in traveling back I'd lost my way home. Lost my ability to harness the speed force. And without it, I was stuck here. Stranded in this time, unable to return to my own. And the only way back was The Flash. But The Flash was gone, and so I created him. Why train me? Why help me save so many people? Because I needed you to get fast. Fast enough to rupture the spacetime barrier and create a stable wormhole through which I could return home. Why would I ever do that? Because Barry Allen, if you give me what I want, I'm gonna give you what you want. You can go back and save your mother. You can prevent your father from going to prison. You can reunite the Allen family. No. No, I don't believe you. I want to kill you right now. I know that rage. I used to feel that rage every time I looked upon you. And now, somehow, I know what Joe and Henry feel when they look on you with pride. With love. No. No. Don't you ever say that to me! I know you're upset, but I'm giving you a chance. I'm giving you a chance to undo all the evil I've done. Don't you want that chance? The rare opportunity to go back in time and right a wrong and save your mother's life quite the paradox Harrison has presented you with, Mr. Allen. The chance to be with someone you love? Seems pretty cut and dry to me. At first blush, Dr. Snow, it would appear so, but this gift has unparalleled risk. Barry, the night your mother died, the night you saved yourself from being killed, that event altered the timeline you were already on and changed the course of history. So what you're saying is we're living in a parallel universe? Just like when I time traveled before. But he he only changed one day that time. Exactly. Now imagine 15 years of compounded experiences. One different decision, no matter how big or small, impacts everything that follows. Moments upon moments, choices upon choices. No relationships, nothing would be as it is today, and you'd never know the difference because you'd never remember any of it. So if I go back and save my mom, my dad doesn't go to prison. I never live with Joe and Iris. You might never meet me. Or Caitlin or Ronnie. Truth is, there's no real way of knowing what your life will be. There's no choice here, Barry. You have to do this. You gotta change the past. Joe? So what what, that's it? You think I should just do it? Yeah, I do. Which means I will never come to live with you, and you're okay with that? Barry, you get the chance to grow up with both parents. You don't have to grow up without a mother. What about growing up without a father? You will have a father your real father. Wells has messed with our lives long enough. This is why you became The Flash, Barry. To put things right. You saved a lot of people's lives this past year. Now it's time to save yours. Dad, look. I know this sounds crazy. I think we're way past crazy, slugger. Look, you're fast, I get it. But turning back time No, I wouldn't be turning time back. I would be going back to that night to save her. And what does Joe think about all this? He thinks I should do it. No. You can't. Dad I can make it so that night will never have happened. We'll be a family again. We are a family. Not like this. Not without Mom. Barry, there's a natural order to things, okay? Things happen the way they do. We may not know why at the time, but there must always be a reason. Now, I believe that. I've had to believe it. I I can save Mom. At what cost? You said time would change. What if it changes you?  I don't care.  I do. I am in awe of the remarkable man that you are becoming all the things you've achieved, and not just as The Flash, but you, Barry. Your honesty. Your heart. You were always a hero. And your mom would be just as proud. And if she had a say in this, if she thought for one second that you going back to save her would mean you losing what makes you so special, she would never want that. Barry, what I hope for you, maybe the greatest thing that a father can hope for his son is that one day, you will become a father yourself. And then you will know How much I truly love you. I don't even know what that word means anymore. Me neither. I know Barry really appreciates you coming back to help him stop Wells. That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait. I'm here now. For good. But I thought I thought too I thought too much about what might happen if the government tracked us down. If we couldn't control our powers and we hurt someone. If we hurt you. But I realized that although sometimes I'm more than one man, I'm not whole unless I'm with you. I love you, Cait.  Are you sure?  I am. Once upon a time and a Particle Accelerator or so ago, you agreed to marry me. Yes, I did. What do you say we do that? Thought I might find you here. I needed to get out of the lab. I thought this would be a good place to think. Oh, it is. Trust me. I've done a lot of thinking up here. When I wasn't having clandestine meetings with the mysterious "streak." Yeah, not mad we lost that name. Hey, I thought that had pizzazz.  No.  Uhuh. So are you gonna do it? It's just so huge. It's the biggest decision of my life, and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it. Why would you want to? I mean, you'd get to see your mom again, your dad, have a great career, even get married. Iris WestAllen, huh? I never really thought of myself as a hyphenator. Must be a 2024 thing. We don't know that that's gonna happen. Do you think that because you didn't live with us, that's why things are different there? Growing up together and knowing so much about each other it made it hard for me to admit how I felt about you. And I waited too long, and you fell in love with Eddie. But living with you and Joe I've had a great life, Iris. Come here, Barry. What do you think I should do? I need someone to tell me. I think that for once in your life, Barry Allen, you should stop thinking about other people. I think you should do what's in your heart. Do what you need to do for yourself. Ah! Well, if it makes you feel any better, it took you a whole hour longer to decide than I thought it would. So how does this work? Your grand plan? Well, it's really not that grand at all, Barry. In fact, it's rather simple. We use the Particle Accelerator. The Particle Accelerator. The last time that happened, you caused an explosion that hurt a lot of people. This time, the accelerator will operate exactly the way it was designed to. Except, instead of two particles moving in opposite directions, colliding at the speed of light in the inner ring, we're only going to inject one particle into the accelerator. And I'm what it collides with. And if you can go fast enough, Barry, if you can hit that particle with enough speed, you will punch a hole right though the fabric of reality. And you will create a portal connecting this time to infinite times. A wormhole. Through which one might travel back to the past, say, to the night your mother died or forward to the future, to, say, my time. You said if I run fast enough. What happens if I don't? If you don't achieve the desired velocity, Barry, you'll die. According to Wells' calculations, Barry superspeeds inside the accelerator ring. Once Barry reaches optimum speed, we then launch a hydrogen proton into the accelerator. Once the collision happens, a wormhole forms, opening a gateway into time itself. It's at that moment I plan on shouting something along the lines of "Eureka" or possibly "Excelsior." I'm uncommitted. What do you think? I mean, on the one hand, it does make a kind of sense. On the other hand, why? Why, why would you ever consider doing this? You know why. So, for this to actually work, how fast would Barry have to go? By my estimates, Mach Two at a minimum. You've never gone that fast. So what happens if Barry doesn't reach that speed? I mean, I'm imagining a bug hitting a windshield. How far off am I? Not very far, I'm afraid. Let me worry about how fast I have to go. We're gonna need something else too. Really? And what's that? 'Cause I don't know about you guys, but I'm not at all interested in helping you get yourself killed. I need you to build a time machine. Go on. So, if Wells is as fast as you, what's he need a time machine for? Apparently he lost his speed when he killed my mom. He gets it back sometimes but only in spurts. He can't fully control it. So I was right about the wheelchair. He was using it to charge himself. So after I open the wormhole, he's gonna need the ship to travel back to the future. He's been squirreling away the parts. Now we just need to put it together. Ronnie, I love you, but this is a time machine, not a bookcase from IKEA. We got a problem. These tiles they're made of tungsten. Well, tungsten does have the highest melting point of any other element. Yeah, but the dust it generates is flammable. The pressure exerted from the wormhole Yeah. Yeah. It could cause a hole to be melted into the exterior. It could explode. Any ideas? Let me ask Dr. Evil. Which used to be a name that made me smile. Something on your mind, Cisco? No. Yes. How did you fit your ReverseFlash suit into that little ring? Is it some sort of compressed micro tech? Or actually, forget it. I don't care. Maybe a little. Ronnie's right. I should have accounted for the temporal shearing. Glad we're still good for something. I never underestimated your contribution, Cisco. Or Ronnie's. Matter of fact, do you know how many times I wished you were there with me as I rebuilt the accelerator? It would have been a lot more fun. Yeah? Well, doesn't change the fact that your nifty little Time Sphere Is that what you're calling it? Whatever it's called. It's gonna blow. Not if you cement the tiles with a cobalt resin. That'll prevent degradation in conditions of extreme heat. Okay. Fine. We'll try that. That's it? That's all? Well, what do you want me to say? I don't know, Cisco. I thought that of anyone, you'd be a little more understanding of my predicament. I don't belong here. These barbaric times. It's like living amongst the dead. Is that what you told yourself? When you killed me? What? What did you say? It was an alternate timeline. One that Barry reset. But I never forgot it. It just kept coming back to me. And I can still picture the way you looked at me when you called me a son and you crushed my heart with your fist. Cisco I'm sorry. Yeah. It sucked. Not for killing you. I'm sure I had a good reason. I'm sorry for the fact that you're able to retain traces of another timeline. You're able to see through the vibrations of the universe. It means I wasn't sure until just now. Sure of what? The night the Particle Accelerator exploded You were affected too. What are you talking about? No. I wasn't. Don't be afraid, Cisco. A great and honorable destiny awaits you now. I only hope that as you're living your great adventure, that you remember who gave you that life. And that it was given out of love. I'm sorry, but I'm told this is the only station with enough power to run these calculations. If we make the slightest error creating the wormhole Say no more. Joe told me to stick around in case I was needed, but it seems I'm only in the way. Everyone has a contribution to make. Perhaps you just haven't discovered yours yet. No, Dr. Wells made it pretty clear when he told me about the future. I don't matter. As far as history's concerned, I don't save the day or get the girl. And you believed him? He had a newspaper from the year 2024. And I have a mug that says "World's Best Boss." I doubt my teaching assistant would testify to its authenticity. We're dealing with a lot of big scientific ideas today. But you, Mr. Thawne, might be the most interesting thing here at S.T.A.R. Labs. Me? What are the odds that Dr. Wells would travel back in time and get stuck in the exact same city as his greatgreatgreat greatgrandfather? Working in the same profession, the same building? And that part of his plan to get home would mean that he'd have to preserve and protect your life. That makes you this rare thing that no scientist can plan for. Which is? Coincidence. There is no science to coincidence. You, sir, are an anomaly. A wild card, as it were. You are the only person in this whole story who gets to choose his own future. At least, that's my opinion. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, dear.  We have a problem.  What? The calculations. There is a danger. I know. I'm ready to take the risk. No, not just to you but to everyone. Wells didn't tell us everything. Barry, even if you do reach the right speed, colliding with the hydrogen particle, there is a chance that explosion could create a singularity. What's a singularity? It's a black hole. We could destroy Central City. For starters. If we create a singularity here and then cannot control it, we could be looking at a global catastrophe. So long and thanks for all the fish. Well, sure, there's a bit of a risk. I would hardly refer to possibly causing an extinctionlevel event as "a bit of a risk." Yeah, and your accelerator's been about as reliable as the beater I drove in high school. Let me ask you a question. How many metahumans how many dangers have we faced this year together? Or did you forget that was me fighting alongside each and every one of you? I have been planning this for almost two decades. It will work. And how do we make sure we don't open a black hole in the middle of Central City? So, once the wormhole stabilizes, Barry will have 1 minute and 52 seconds to alter the past and return to this time. If and when he does that, you can close the wormhole, and we can all live happily ever after. Almost two minutes. More than enough time to save Nora. But not enough time to stop you from going home? Everything's a choice. And what if I'm late? You won't be. I believe in you, Barry. Always have. So I guess the question is, do your friends and family believe in you as much as I do? So, if I don't run fast enough to collide with the particle, then I'm dust, and if I do run fast enough but I'm not back here in time, then a black hole will form, swallow up the city and possibly the world. You're sure you still want to look me in the eyes and tell me this is for the best? I'd be lying if I told you I did. Truth is, I don't I don't know what to think. I thought you were the sure one. I was kind of banking on that when I made my decision the first time. I was faking it. Sometimes parents do that. Most of the time, parents do that. Look, of course I'm scared. But I didn't want you to not help your mother because you were worried about me. Well, I'll always worry about you, Joe, just like you'll always worry about me. Sorry, but you can't stop that. Do you think I can do this? You think I can save my mom? I mean, do you think I'm fast enough? Yes. I know you are. You know, I've I've dreamed my whole life about saving her, freeing my dad, and I never thought I'd have to lose another parent to do that. Barry Joe, it's true. It's true. I've always been so focused on everything that I lost that night, but I gained so much too. I was born with one father, and that tragedy gave me another. And I don't think I can lose you. You won't ever lose me. Ever, you hear me? Ever. Wow, slow news day? If they only knew, right? I thought you would be at S.T.A.R. Labs. I was. Then I got hungry, so I went to Mama Chows. For dim sum? Your favorite. And to remind myself of something. What? A coincidence. A pretty big coincidence, actually. About a year and a half ago, I had a date with this girl. Katie Rogers. She was a dancer. We had plans to meet at Mama Chows, but she texted me. She pulled a hamstring and had to cancel. Oh, those fragile dancers. I was bummed 'cause I was looking forward to it. So I had dinner by myself, and I was walking home when I saw a mugger running with a stolen backpack. Your backpack. And I arrested him. That's how you and I met. I remember. Someone just told me how powerful a coincidence can be, and it made me realize how many coincidences had to happen for you and I to get together in this time. We've all been so focused on Barry's destiny, I forgot that I have one too. And it's you. Iris West, every moment of my life led to meeting you. Screw the future. Screw the future. Is this actually binding? My father made me become a rabbi before he would send me to MIT. This will be "legit," as the kids say. No kids say that. Let's not fight on our wedding day. If it's all right with everyone, I'd like to skip all the Hebrew. I've learned a lot about merging one's life with another this past year. Yet, for all the incredible advancements in science we've all been party to, the mystery that brings two people together through love is still the province of magic. Mr. Ramon, the rings please. I owe you a real ring. I don't need one. I have everything and everyone that I could ever need right here. And if all the events of the past year have led us to this moment, it was worth it. I love you, Ronnie. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Stop telling me what to do. Okay. There are gonna be three yous back there the you from the future who saved younger you from the ReverseFlash and now you you. Remember, wait until future you gets younger you out of there, and then you can go and save your mom. Piece of cake. May the Speed Force be with you. Goodbye, Dad. Goodbye, Son. Iris You don't have to say anything. I already know. I hope whatever life you get, it's enough for you. That it makes you happy. You too. Remember, Mr. Allen, assuming you achieve the proper velocity and open the wormhole, you will only have 1 minute and 52 seconds to save your mother and return. Or else I know. Well you hold both our futures in your hands now, Mr. Allen. And I know you can do it. Now Run Barry. Run. The accelerator's structural integrity is holding. What was that? Is Barry okay? Yeah. He just passed Mach Two. I was waiting for you to bring Barry home. Looks like he's going to be staying with us for a while. Barry, what you're seeing is the Speed Force: your past, you present, your future all at once. So you need to focus on where you want to go. So think about that night. Think about your mother. Time for bed. Good night, slugger. Mom! It's working. It's working. Inject the hydrogen particle now. What's that? What happened? Barry he's gone.  Look.  The wormhole. And it's stable. Start the clock. Mom! Mom! Barry! Mom! Nora! Hold on! Run, Barry, run! Barry, no! No, no, no! Hey. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Please. My husband, my son, are they They're okay. They're both safe. I promise. Who are you? I'm I'm The Flash. I don't understand. You look just like my father. This won't make any sense, but it's me, Mom. It's Barry. Barry? Your Barry. Oh, my beautiful boy. I got a second chance to come back here and Tell you that I'm okay. Dad and I are both okay. And we love you, Mom. I love you. I love you. Oh, my sweet boy. Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Barry. Mom. Mom. I believe it's time to say goodbye to Harrison Wells. It's beautiful. Rip Hunter would be impressed. He built the first one of these. Interesting man. Now what the hell is that? That's my cue to leave. Thank you, Cisco. Don't ever come back. Home.  Oh, my God.  Barry. We have to shut down the wormhole quickly! Caitlin! You didn't save her. Why? Why? You could have had the life you wanted. You could have had everything you ever wanted! I already do. Not for long. Cut the internal generators. Ten seconds, hurry. Three, two, one. Ronnie, are you okay? Did you do it? Yes, I turned them all off. They did it. They cut the generator. Just so we're clear, after I kill you, I'm going to kill them. And then I'm going to kill your father. I always win, Flash. Eddie! Oh, my Eddie! What did you do? What did you do? What did you do? No such thing as a coincidence. What's happening? Cisco, help me. Eddie's his ancestor. If Eddie dies, he'll never be born, and He's being erased from existence. No! No! Eddie. Eddie, no, no. Stay with me, okay? Stay. He was wrong, it turns out. I'm a hero after all. You are, Eddie. You are my hero. That's all I ever wanted to be. Your hero. No! I've controlled your life for so long, Barry. How will you get along without me? Guys, that's not good. Professor, I shut down the wormhole.  What's happening?  I don't know. You did close it, but it seems to be reopening. We got to go. You okay? Iris, we have to go. I'm not leaving him. We have to go now, honey. I'm sorry. So that's what we didn't want to happen.  What's it doing?  Feeding. The singularity won't stop, not even after the Earth is gone. I'm afraid the accretion disc has already assembled. What? Diffuse material that's in orbital motion around the singularity. What does that mean? We have to disrupt the motion. Basically it's just like the tornado, only upside down. And bigger. And scarier. Barry, that event has an energy level of at least 6.7 Tera Electron Volts. It cannot be stopped. I have to try. Oh, God. Barry.
What's happening to me? I wasn't the only one affected, was I? We've been searching for other metahumans, like yourself. Don't be afraid, Cisco. You were affected, too. Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me. Yes, I did. What do you say we do that? Harrison Wells is the ReverseFlash.  knife sinking in  You killed my mother! Why? We're enemies, rivals, opposites, reverses of one another. Just tell the police what you did. Get my dad out of prison! You could go back and save your mother. A wormhole, opening the gateway into time itself. I always win, Flash! Eddie! Eddie's his ancestor. If Eddie dies, he'll never be born. He's being erased from existence. The singularity won't stop, not even after the Earth is gone. We have to disrupt the motion. It cannot be stopped! I have to try. dramatic music suspenseful music  He's coming back around!  Yeah, to die! both grunting I swear one of these days I will kill you! grunts groans I was late again, wasn't I? laughs Right on time.  sirens wailing  Whoo! laughs Two down at the same time? Superhero double play, baby!  Didn't do it alone.  You're never alone, Barry. Neither are you, Mrs. Raymond. groans Thank you for not doing that when I was inside you. It happened one time. Let it go. Snart and Rory. You're gonna put a cop like me out of a job. Just trying to help. You do more than help, Barry. You give the people of this city hope. You're the hero, Barry. Congratulations, everyone. A spectacular victory. A milestone, if you will. Mr. Allen, I believe there's nothing left I can teach you. I believe that you're ready to do all of this on your own. quiet beeping My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible, and I became the Flash. I used my powers to find the man responsible for my mother's death. I thought I would finally get justice for my family, but I failed. It's been six months since the Singularity. I'm on my own now. Decided it's better that way. Keeps the people I care about safe. There's only one thing I can do now. I run. How's it going? Hey. Uh, good. How you doing? Good. So, the victim. His name is Al Rothstein. He's a welder here at the nuclear plant. Coworker found him this morning. So, what do you got? Petechiae on his face and the whites of his eyes, and this bruising around his neck  Oh, so he was strangled.  Mmhmm. By someone very strong and very large. Or something? This wasn't Grodd. Oh, thank God.  sighs  Look, I'll let you know when I find more. So this Flash Day thing. I'm hoping you're planning on making an appearance. Ah I haven't decided. Bar, I heard the Mayor's trying to give you the key to the city. Yeah, I don't need an award. You love getting awards. Like all those science trophies you got in high school? Those I deserved. I'll let you know what I find, all right? All right. camera shutter clicks Flash Day is almost here. A special downtown rally to honor the man who saved Central City. It's been six months since the Flash saved Central City from the freak black hole that erupted in the sky. Joe, where are we at with the murder at the nuclear plant? Barry's still analyzing the evidence, but there was definitely something weird. Yeah, which is why I let you have that AntiMetaHuman Task Force. Speaking of which, where's your scientific advisor? Ho, ho, ho! Fear the beard! It's a very distinguished look Sir.  What is all this, Mr. Ramon?  Oh, this right here? This is a little something I'm working on. I'm cooking it up for Joe and the task force to take down metahumans. I'm think I'm going to call it The Boot. Oh, here are the receipts. sighs Oh, um, Captain, one more thing. You are not getting a badge, Mr. Ramon. chuckles He's really stingy with those badges, isn't he? Yeah, cops are funny that way. So you really think you can get this to work? Don't have me caught out on the streets with my pants down. Yes, once I finish the Boot, CCPD will totally have what it needs to take down a metahuman. Especially now that Barry has decided to go all Lone Wolf McQuade and fight crime by himself. I know, right? Have you spoken to him? Not really. Haven't even heard from Caitlin since she started work at Mercury Labs.  Hey Cisco. Hi, Dad.  Hey, baby. Hey, I was wondering if you'd talked to Barry about the rally.  We was just saying.  both chuckle I'm sorry, but, I can't believe they're gonna give the Flash the key to the city. Although technically, as members of Team Flash, we should all be getting keys. Well, you know Barry. The more we try to convince him to do something, the less he's gonna want to do it. Yeah, but he should go. Someone should try and get through to him. Maybe his best friend. Joe, believe me, I've tried. I meant her. Bye, baby.  Yeah.  Okay.  whooshing  fast hammering  drill whirring  whooshing  whooshing  drill whirring exhales You know, if you ever decided that you didn't want to be the Flash, you have a good future being a contractor. chuckles Thanks. Yeah, I'm just trying to put it all back exactly how it was before the You know. clears throat Seems like a lot of local businesses are being rebuilt at night. In secret. I was thinking about writing an article about it for the paper. Don't. Please. Look, people have heard the stories. They've read the articles. They've maybe even seen the red streak racing past them. But they've never seen the Flash, Barry. So that's why you're here? You came to talk me into going to the rally? 'Cause I'm I'm not gonna go. People just want to thank the man who saved Central City. Well, they can't, 'cause that's not me. You should know that, better than anyone. sighs Central City believes in the Flash. So do I. crowd panicking  rumbling  wind blowing  thunder rumbling  debris crashing crowd screaming woman screams Brilliant! He's contained the Singularity by adding to its angular momentum! Barry, it's stabilizing. Keep doing what you're doing! I'm not sure how much longer I can.  Cisco!  Now what? We have to merge the inner and outer event horizons. How do we do that? By separating in the eye of it. The amount of energy from the fissure should do the trick. It's our only hope, Ronald. Ronnie, no! It's too dangerous. What if you can't escape the inrush? Cait, we have to try. dramatic music   Ronnie Professor No! panting Ronald Ronald I'm so sorry. emotional music  marching band plays  crowd cheers Are we expecting trouble? Cops always expect trouble. In this city, I expect super evil flying monsters. That's a solid expectation. chuckles Well, I'll be. crowd cheering Good morning, Central City! A year ago, our world changed. Our city became ground zero for some pretty weird stuff. We got a new breed of criminal: Men and women who defied not only our laws, but physics and reason. But we got something else, too. We got the Flash! crowd cheers Our wounds run deep, and I know many of you are afraid of what threats tomorrow may bring. But the Flash doesn't just protect us, he restores hope where it was lost. That's why I'm honored to present the key to the man who saved Central City: The Flash! crowd cheers whooshing noise crowd cheers crowd chants "Flash!" Flash. Flash. crown continues to chant "Flash!"  emotional music  crowd continues chanting The doors to Central City will forever be open for you, Flash. people scream Look out! crowd screams You all right? I got this, all right? The man who saved Central City, hate to rain on your parade. Oof! tires screech Cisco! Cisco!  The Boot!  Right! gun shots Locked and loaded. Go! Booted! buzzing noise grunts roars Cisco, you said this thing would take him down. He's not going down. He went up. Run! Run!  What are you doing?  I'm throwing, you're shooting. grunts roars That's Al Rothstein. The body we found at the nuclear plant, he's alive! According to the coroner's office, Al Rothstein's body was in the morgue all night, so we can scratch off "zombie attack." Rothstein have a twin brother? Nope. Only child. And get this, the night the accelerator exploded, Rothstein was on his honeymoon, in Hawaii. Huh. So we're looking for a guy who's really strong, can grow twice his size, and just happens to look exactly like the guy he murdered? I would think this meta was really cool if everything about him didn't just terrify me to my core. Is that what happened to you? You looked really spooked there for a minute.  Uh  I actually see the guy that I can ask about it right now. Call you back, okay? Hey. So, the hospital next to the Flash Day rally, The xray and CT machines all failed at once. Was that because of you? I did not do anything that would cause that. I'm 92% sure. I'm going to go make that 100. Excuse me. You okay?  We need to talk.  Okay. Barry can't do this alone anymore. sighs That's his plan and I don't know how to talk him out of it. At this point, I'm just trying not to push him farther away. Well, maybe Barry has been so successful at pushing you, me and everyone else away because we keep letting him. Let's not let him. What do you suggest? Well, "if you keep getting 'no' for an answer, stop asking questions." I say that. You quoting me to me? What can I say? You are a very smart man. chuckles So this is what it looks like inside Mercury Labs. Security here is way better than it was at S.T.A.R. Labs, what with people walking in and out of the Cortex all the time.  Hi Cisco.  Sweet Sarek. Is that a 6K proton splicer? Yes, it is. Dr. McGee insists on having all the latest technology. Wow. You deserve it. chuckles I spotted you, at the rally today, and I'm guessing you saw what happened. Cisco, I can't come back. Okay, check this out: we found this on a victim at the nuclear power plant, but the badge shows absolutely nothing at all, which is so weird. What's also weird is that at the same time that metahuman grew, all the xray machines within a mile radius just went bellyup.  Cisco.  Just if you could just See if the badge was tampered with or something. I mean, if it's broken, or Whatever. It'll really help. Mr. Allen. Barry Allen?  Yeah.  I'm Greg Turk. I'm an attorney at Weathersby and Stone. I don't usually make house calls, but I've been trying to get in touch with you for several months. Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I've just, um I've been really busy with police work. We need to talk about S.T.A.R. Labs. As you know, Harrison Wells left the property to you as part of his living trust. Yeah, which I did not ask him to do, but I've been keeping the place up. Well, It's going to take more than cleaning the floors to retain it, I'm afraid. The facility and the real estate are scheduled to go into receivership at the end of this week unless you watch this. What is this? A video message drafted by Dr. Wells. What's on it? Have you seen it? No. He was very specific. It was only to be watched by you. The device will send me a notification after you've viewed it. And at that point, I'll have everything ready to execute. I'm not going to watch that. Well, that's up to you, Mr. Allen. I'm only here to represent Harrison Wells' final request. Good day. quiet music beeping What are you guys doing here?  Working.  So, Caitlin was right. Yes, all humans contain small amounts of radiation due to contact with cell phones, microwaves, televisions, et cetera. Our bodies are natural conductors. I think our meta's been sucking up all the radiation around him and using it to power himself. Which is why the xray machines at the hospital failed the day of the rally. So if we want to find him, we gotta look for places without radiation. All right, guys, I don't want any of you here right now. Tough. You need your partners. You need your friends. Barry, everyone in this room cares about you, but we also care about this city. We all want to make a difference, and that means fighting metahumans, and that means working with the Flash. You can't deny us that.  Not anymore.  Got him. There's a three block dead zone near a hazardous waste reclamation plant. It should be blooming with rads, and right now it's at zero. That's where you'll find your atom smasher. chuckles Because he absorbs atomic power, and he, well, smashes.  Come here.  chuckles That's a great name. Welcome to the team.  Thank you.  Great, guys, thank you. You can go now, all right? Barry, you need to let Cisco and Stein figure out a way to stop this guy. No, I don't. all sigh Barry left his comm system behind. We can't talk to him. He's on his own. sighs inhaling exhaling Well, this is a curve ball. I thought I was going to have to come looking for you. I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.  I'm only here to hurt you, buddy.  Yeah? Then why'd you kill Albert Rothstein? And why do you look like him? You wouldn't believe me if I told you.  chuckles Try me.  I'm about to. Is there really no way of knowing what's going on in there? I'm looking for the security cameras. Booyah. heroic music My turn. choking  Dad.  Maybe I can make it there. No, you won't, and what are you gonna do when you get there? The Boot didn't work on him. Alarm!  Believe me, we're all alarmed.  No, the alarm system. You've tapped into the surveillance cameras, correct? Correct! "Come on, feel the noize." grunts grunting and choking He said you were some kind of big hero, but you don't seem worthy of him, or this city. alarm blares sighs Professor Stein, you are a genius. I believe that's already been well established. laughs gasping No, thank you. Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite. I'm not hungry. It's been six months, Barry. You gotta eat, son. sighs It's a good move, being angry all the time. I get it. You miss your mom and dad, and you want to show them that you're strong. Being mad makes it easier. Tougher thing to do would be to let yourself feel. It's okay to be sad. You can be sad, Barry. Your parents will understand if you're not strong all the time. That is why I'm here. It's okay, son. I got you. heart monitor beeping You're good. I got you. Where is everyone? I figured you wouldn't want an audience when you came to. scoffs Yeah, thanks. Iris is right. You're not gonna do this anymore. For the last six months I've given you your space to work all this out, come back to us. But today proved that you'd rather just get yourself killed. chuckles It's better than getting my friends killed. You want me to tell you that it wasn't your fault? I can't. It was. Guess what? You weren't the only person making decisions that day. All of the rest of us were there too. Eddie and Ronnie, they chose to help you stop Wells, and stop that  Singularity.  Singularity thing. It's on all of us, Barry. So stop with this hogging all the blame and regret. We gotta live with it. Move on. What do I do now? Well, I know that you've been rebuilding Central City at night. It's just bricks and paint. Maybe you should start trying to rebuild things that really matter. What are you doing here? Sorry, I should've called or something. I just I wanted to see you. It's been a while. Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you at the Flash Day celebration. I was surprised. You, better than anyone, know that I wasn't the hero that day.  Of course you were.  No. sighs Cait, Ronnie died saving me, and I should've saved him, and I'm I'm so sorry. Barry, I know that you did everything you could. It wasn't your fault. I don't blame you for Ronnie's death. I blame myself. Why? When Ronnie first became Firestorm, he asked me to leave Central City, and go somewhere that we could have a normal life. And I said no. I couldn't leave S.T.A.R. Labs, Dr. Wells you. If I had gone with him, Ronnie would still be alive. Being at S.T.A.R. Labs just made me think of that every single day. Here. Oh, you carry a handkerchief now? What are you, 80? object clatters to floor  What's that?  Ah, it's uh Apparently, in case of his death, Wells had some kind of a living will. And you haven't watched it yet? No. No, I've been too afraid. What if we watched it together? All right. sighs Hello, Barry. If you're watching this, that means something has gone horribly wrong. I'm dead and the last 15 years have been for nothing. Bummer. 15 years. You know, when I realize that in all those years helping raise you, we were never truly enemies, Barry. I'm not the thing you hate. And so, I want to give you the thing that you want most. It won't matter. You'll never be truly happy, Barry Allen, trust me. I know you. Now clears throat Erase everything I said up to this point. Give the following message to the police. My name is Harrison Wells. Being of sound mind and body, I freely confess to the murder of Nora Allen. In her home, on the night of March 18th, in the year 2000. I attacked Nora Allen in her dining room.  Oh, my God.  I stabbed her in the chest  with a large butcher knife  He confessed. From the drawer to the left of the sink in the kitchen. This is it. laughs This is what I need to free my dad. Hey, Joe. Yeah, hey. Can you have everybody meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs? Yeah. All right, thanks. Yeah. All right, bye. exhales I'll drive. Okay. You think the video's enough? Mmhmm. Well, sure.  What's she saying?  Hold on. Wells gave all the right details. It's not a done deal yet, but the D.A. says it looks good. Yeah, I'm here. Is it good news?  I think so.  Henry's coming home? Oh! laughs Okay, well that still leaves Atom Smasher to deal with. Last time you faced him, it did not go well. No, it did not. I clearly can't stop him by myself. So how are we gonna beat him? Well, ever since I was shown a drained radiation tag, which I haven't been able to stop thinking about.  Thank you, Cisco.  You're welcome, Caitlin. If this guy likes radiation so much, I say we give it to him. sighs dramatic music   Showtime. What's up? I see you got my message. That light was perfect bait. What made you think of that? I don't know, I think I saw it in a comic book somewhere. You want me? You're gonna have to catch me. growls It's working, dude. Rothstein's following you. I must say, he's quite agile for a man his size. Run, Barry, run. Come on. crashing noises dramatic music Didn't think I could catch you, huh? No, I knew you could. Now, Cisco! beeping alarm blares The amount of radiation about to flood that room Atom Smasher won't be able to absorb it all.  alarm blares  growling heroic music roaring The radiation's been cleared. It's safe for you to go in. I'm sorry. I couldn't let you hurt anyone else. Why? Why did you want to kill me? gasping He promised he'd take me home if I killed you. Who? Who promised you that? gasping Zoom. panting Let's get out of here.  I'll race you.  laughs You will lose. X Ambassadors' "Renegades" plays All: Welcome home! cheers and applause  Run awayay with me   Budumdumdum, budumdumdum   Budumdumdum   Lost souls in revelry   Budumdumdum, budumdumdum   Budumdumdum   Running wild and running free   Budumdumdum, budumdumdum   Budumdumdum   Two kids, you and me   Budumdumdum, budumdumdum   And I say hey, hey, hey, hey   Living like we're renegades   Renegades   Renegades  finger clinks against glass Gather round, everyone, please. Looking at all of you, thinking how far we've all come, and remembering those who are no longer with us, I'm reminded of a Hebrew word used during times of graduation. Kadima. It means, "Forward." Forward. Forward. Forward.  Forward.  Forward. Forward.  Forward.  Forward.  Well said.  Thank you. clears throat  You good?  Ah, yeah. laughs Stuff goes to your head after being away from it for 14 years. I bet. All right, well, look. I was thinking, what if, in the morning, the two of us started looking for an apartment for both of us, and Iris has actually been doing some research on how to get your medical license back so you could start your practice up again, or, if you wanted, come work with us at S.T.A.R. Labs. I don't know. I mean  What's wrong? You okay?  Yeah, it's a party. Come on, we can talk about all this tomorrow.  Talk about what?  Barry Are you not planning on sticking around? Okay. Okay, do you think Can you be all that you are becoming With me here? chuckles You're the only family that I have left. Well, that's not really true, is it? Don't you have another family in this room? They need your help too, Barry. When you need me, I will be here, but right now, Central City doesn't need you to be Henry Allen's son. It needs you to be the Flash. My kid. The superhero. sighs I have to go. I need you to tell me that it's okay. Yeah. melancholy music elevator dings  Hey.  Hey. Your dad get off okay? Yeah, I just dropped him at the station. You good? I don't know, I Just feels like every time I win, I still lose. Well It's not bad. No, it's not bad.  It's pretty cool.  It's really cool, come on!  Hey!  Hey.  Ho ho!  Hey, guess what? I added a little upgrade to your suit. chuckles It's just like the one from the future newspaper Gideon showed us. I was thinking, you know, you shouldn't fear the future anymore, right? No, and it'll be here faster than we think. Well, see, I like it. The lightning definitely pops more against the white. And S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever. Increased security and surveillance. Recoded, double firewalled, electronic lock sets. Nothing is getting through here without us knowing. So people can't just waltz in and out of here.  Exactly.  gasps  For real?  Stay where you are. Who are you? You don't know me, but I know you Barry Allen. Take one more step, it'll be the last step you take. The man asked you a question. Who the hell are you? My name is Jay Garrick, and your world is in danger.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other metahumans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats. And I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on The Flash No! The man who saved Central City. Why did you want to kill me?  He promised he'd take me home.  Who?  Zoom.  Wells killed my mother. I don't know anything anymore, especially who I can and can't trust. S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever. People can't just waltz in and out of here.  Exactly.  gasps  Stay where you are.  My name is Jay Garrick. Your world is in danger, Barry Allen. Please, just let me explain. I mean you no harm. How do you know my name? I know all your names. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, Detective Joe West Enough. That part about explaining needs to happen right about now. This world is in danger. What other worlds are there? When you created the singularity above Central City, you also created a breach between my world and yours. I'm sorry, a breach? Yes, a portal connecting our two Earths. And what precisely is your concern? A few days ago, you found a dead man named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant. But then a different Al Rothstein tried to kill you. Atom Smasher. That man was from my world. If he got through the breach, I suspect there'll be more to follow. Okay, so, Jay, how exactly do you know all of this? Where I came from, I was a speedster like you. They called me The Flash. stirring music Before I arrived on your Earth, I was in a fight with a man named Zoom. Zoom? I've heard that name before. Atom Smasher, he said Zoom sent him here to kill me. Who is this guy? He's a speedster, like you and me. And fast. Maybe the fastest of all. But evil. He is an unstoppable demon with the face of death. dramatic music We were engaged in our fiercest battle ever, racing throughout my city. But I wasn't fast enough to stop him.  screaming  Zoom had me beaten. Aah! He was about to kill me when suddenly there was a blinding light and the sky split open. A breach, between my world and yours, caused from the singularity. It pulled me in   And I somehow ended up in your world. Powerless. Unable to return home. What do you mean? I lost my speed. How? Not entirely sure. So, you've been in Central City for six months. Why haven't you come to see us before? I'm in a foreign world here, Detective. I didn't know who you all were. Took me that long to piece it all together. So that's how you know our names. You've been following us. Look, I know how this sounds. The existence of another Earth, you, another Flash, it all came as an unexpected shock to me, too. I just wish there was something I could do to convince you. There is. We're gonna do some tests on you. See if you're telling us the truth. 'Cause if you're not, this Zoom, he's not gonna be your only enemy. grunting Where the hell am I? You want to go home? You only have to do one thing. What's that? Kill The Flash. dramatic music So, Mr. Garrick, how long have you been The Flash on your world? Not long enough to call me Mister. Please, it's Jay. Jay, of course. On my world, I've been The Flash for about two years. And how did you get your speed? Not really sure. I was at my lab trying to purify heavy water without any residual radiation when there was a blinding light. I fell into a coma. When I woke up, I could run almost as fast as the speed of light. Sorry. Did you say lab? Are you a scientist? Well, I certainly didn't work at a place like this, but, yeah. I had a respectable solo operation. Parttime chemist, parttime physicist.  Parttime superhero.  Hmm. I can forget that superhero part now, though, huh? Is any of this possible? A breach to another Earth? It's not, right? The contrary. Just recently, the manydifferentworlds theory proposed interaction with parallel universes was plausible. Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true, that theory's been proven sooner than we all thought. It doesn't add up. I'm gonna be honest here, I don't understand what the hell any of you are talking about. So, Jay is saying he's from, like, a mirrorworld. Or a parallel universe that's very, very similar to ours. Multiverse would be a more apt description.  No, not helping.  Bless your heart. Okay, let's see if this helps. This is our Earth. Let's call it Earth1. And this second Earth, let's call it Earth2. This is where Jay claims to be from. And these other Earths, three, four, five, to infinity, all of them, are nearly identical to ours. And they all exist at the same time, giving us endless alternatives to what we have here. For example, the Joe West on Earth2, your doppelganger, he might not be a detective. He could be a Nobel Prizewinning physicist. And you, the Barry Allen here is The Flash, but over there, he could be an electrician. So, I'm assuming that the people on all these other Earths work to make money to pay bills and such.  I would imagine.  So we got that in common. I'm heading back to the station. Call me when this makes a little bit more sense. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this whole idea of time travel. laughs softly There is, uh, one problem that remains. If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth, there is a breach somewhere in Central City that we need to find and close for good. Yeah, but how do we find it? We don't even know what to look for. Well, I I suggest we put our heads together and come up with a solution. Not literally, of course. Those days are over.  What'd you find?  Well, Jay's heart rate is extraordinarily low. And he does have regenerative capabilities. Other than that, I'm not seeing any evidence of the Speed Force in his system. We don't even have proof that he's a speedster, much less from another Earth? Not necessarily. What does that mean? Well, Jay doesn't know this, but while I was testing his heart rate, blood pressure, and motor responses, I also measured his autonomic reactions while we were talking. You gave him a lie detector test? And he passed it. What if he's not a good guy, and he just wants to find our weaknesses? Keep running tests. See what else you can find out. phone vibrating phone beeps Detective West, sir. Yes, Officer? Spivot. Patty Spivot. Captain Singh mentioned there may be positions available on your antimetahuman task force. Yeah, everybody quit. There is no task force anymore. Well, I know someone who's interested in being on it. Me. You do realize that metahumans have superpowers, right?  laughs softly  And even if they didn't, you wouldn't be a good fit for the team. Because I'm a woman? I didn't mean to imply that. Good, because I know how difficult this job would be, but I think I'm an excellent candidate. I triplemajored at Hudson in biology, chemistry, and physics. I'm in prime physical condition. And I rated top of my class in marksmanship. Your class? You don't even have your stripes yet. Soon. Been on the job seven months, sir. Are you aware of what happened to my previous partner? Detective Thawne, yes. I know that he died and the one before him, Fred Chyre, died, too, but the one before that's not dead, just transferred. I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.  Listen, Officer  Spivot, Patty Spivot. Yes, Spivot, the answer's no. All I'm asking for is a shot, sir.  Please, just an interview.  You just had the interview. Didn't get the job. electronics beeping I hope you understand why we have to do this. I get it, kid. You're doing what you think you have to. But you'll all realize soon enough that this, the tests, it's unnecessary. I want to help you, Barry, not harm you. You're not the first person that's said that to me. If what you told me about Zoom is true, that he sent Rothstein here to kill you, instead of locking me up in here, you better start listening. Because if Zoom is involved, you are gonna need a lot more than just me at your side to stay alive. Barry, there's a fire at the waterfront. Fire department's en route. I'm on my way. Be careful. stirring music   sirens blaring indistinct chatter heroic music That was the Flash.   panting That was a big fire. It's out, Cisco. Copy that, see you in a bit. smacking lips panting rustling grunting suspenseful music   I thought it would be harder than this. grunts   Barry? Hello? Are you there?  What was that?  I don't know. We need to find out. camera shutter clicks  Bar.  Hey. What are we dealing with here? Pfft. Well, definitely a metahuman. Had a pretty solid look at him between punches. And he was, like, made of sand.  Sand?  Mmhmm.  Okay.  These walls are too porous to pull any prints. I can't even get one off the boat, but check this out. There's gasoline burns everywhere. Water didn't go off. Sprinklers weren't working. This was arson. Excuse me? Barry Allen?  Yeah.  Hi. Two days in a row, Officer. What a coincidence. Or kismet, if you believe in destiny or fate. Uh  I'm Patty. Patty Spivot.  Hey. I'm really excited to meet you.  I'm a huge fan.  Excuse me? Your forensic reports. I I read them sometimes. Oh. Who am I kidding? All the time. I've actually read them all. Wow, I don't think that I've read them all. They're always so detailed. You know, they really paint a picture like you were somehow actually there when somebody was being brutally murdered. Thank you. playful music Uh, anyhow, I I found, uh, something. Well, I think I found something. It's just a theory,  but I would like to show you.  Great. So, this right here is the point of origin of the fire. And look. I don't know a sandblaster on the market that can make a cut that precise, so I think a metahuman may have done this. Here. Took a sample for you. Uh, there's also some fingerprints on the back of the pipe. You should have gone into CSI work. I love the science, but out here's where all the action is. Isn't that right, Detective West? Mm. The answer's still no, Officer S  Spivot, yeah.  Spivot. What was that about? I'm trying to join the antimetahuman task force.  Ah.  But you heard him. Hey, he's kinda like your dad, right? So, do you have any advice on how I can crack his nocode? Yeah, I've been trying to pick that lock since I was 11. So, if you figure it out, how about you let me know?  Deal.  All right. It was nice to meet you, Barry. Yeah, you too. Ahem. His blood pressure is low, his heart rate is low, his oxygen levels are impressive. Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's. No, but he's certainly in the physical specimen range.  In more ways than one.  Hmm? Oh, I wasn't paying attention. That's enough for today, Jay. Thank you. Found it at the crime scene. I mean, it's gotta be from the metahuman that attacked me. Huh. What is this stuff? Sand?  sighs  It's not sand. It's human cells whose myosin II protein have migrated to the cell's periphery. Jay's a fellow science nerd. Those cells have the ability to rearrange and harden, giving them the appearance of sand. And how do you know this? They belong to a metahuman I've fought before named Sand Demon. I know you're new here, so I'm just gonna break it down for you. The whole "naming the bad guys" thing, that's my jam. But you know what? I'm gonna let you have that one 'cause I actually kinda like it. I'm not mad at that one. Is that Barry's sweatshirt? Oh, uh, sorry. It was all we could find, so I was gonna say, 'cause it looks a lot smaller on you, right? Chuckles I gotta do this thing. So, who is this Sand Demon? I don't know his name, but I know how to stop him. You know what? I think we'll be fine on our own. Look, Barry, I don't know what else I can do to prove to you I'm on your side. I've been poked, prodded. I even subjected myself to a full body scan. I was being thorough. Sand Demon's from my world. Let me teach you how to stop him. Yeah, I don't need you to teach me anything, Jay. Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you. He must have sent Sand Demon here to do the same thing. Don't you get it? Anyone close to the Flash, all of you, are in a lot of danger. All right. If you're so good, you would have caught him already. tense music Let's get Jay back to his cell.   Whoa. Hey, beautiful mind, I think you need to take a breather. After some, uh, lengthy calculations, I believe I have discovered the key to proving the proposed breach theory. Exotic matter. Huh. You mean, like, transdimensional energy? Precisely. Exotic matter, transdimensional energy will theoretically leak from one universe into another. Now, if this breach Mr. Garrick's talking about is real, if there is indeed a hole in our universe which leads to his Earth We can make some adjustments and upload an electrophotography program to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite and essentially photograph the exotic matter leak. Thereby giving us the locale of said breach. Last time I saw the kit, it was in the fabrication room.  I shall return.  Oh, hoo, hoo.  Haha!  Getting gooseys. All right. Let's see what you're made of. That's too much. dark music   Barry?   I thought it'd be harder than this. heavy breathing What's happening to me? dark music  Hey.  I found our meta. His name is Eddie Slick. We tracked those prints to his address. All right, where are you? I'll meet you there. Too late. He made me. What? Joe? dramatic music   grunts groans   So, can I be on your task force? That look familiar?  How about now?  Grunts  What's it look like?  A fire. There you go, genius. It's the fire you started in the third ward last night. Man, I didn't start no fire there last night. What? Were you out of town? Your cat get sick? Well, let me guess. You don't start fires anymore. You been rehabilitated. Yeah, I done it before. So what? I didn't do this one. I always start a fire with something that's hard to trace. You know, like acetone or something. Or maybe you don't need to use accelerants anymore. Iron Heights can hold people like you now. You know that, right? You think I'm one of those metahuman freaks? If I had powers, you don't think I would have used them to get away from you? December, 2013. Where were you?  Why?  Answer the damn question.  Where were you?  Blackgate Penitentiary. You don't believe me. Check your records. Jimmy, I need you to confirm something for me. So, Joe told me what you did. I'm impressed. chuckles No, all I did was, you know, run the other print from the electrical pipe, then track Slick down from there. That's all. Chuckles  Yeah.  Both laugh How's it going with Joe? You any closer to cracking his nocode? Are you kidding me? He's like the permission Sphinx. Or like a Magic 8Ball with just one answer. Or like, you know, the Bridgekeeper protecting the Holy Grail.  What is your quest?  Oh, to join your task force.  No.  Both: Aah! laughter Well, maybe I can put in a good word for you. That would mean a lot to me, Barry.  He needs me.  Yeah. laughs Okay, so, Slick wasn't in Central City the night the particle accelerator exploded. He's lying. He's a dirt bag, and an arsonist, but he's not lying about this. He's not a meta, Barry. Slick is the guy who jumped me. Do you think it's possible that the Slick in there has a A doppelganger? I don't know. Yesterday's surprise broadcast from a Star City vigilante who is calling himself the Green Arrow has spawned a massive outcry of both support and dissenters Catchy. I hate it when they put a color in their name.  Yo.  Yo.  The sample you gave us?  Yeah. Not sand. Definitely human cells. Yeah, I know. It's not him, I get it. I hate to say it, but I think this Earth2 theory  is starting to make sense.  For real? What, you think Jay is lying about the Sand Demon? I don't know. That's my point. But I'm not gonna just believe some guy that walks in here and says a few things that sort of check out. Sort of? He was he was right about Zoom. We don't even know anything about Zoom. What is Zoom? Is Zoom even real? Right now, that's just, you know, a story around a campfire. I mean, have you discovered a breach yet? Not yet, but we know how to now. Have you found one thing to suggest that Jay is a speedster? Is the Speed Force even in his system? It doesn't appear to be, no. See? We are scientists. You are a journalist. We test, we prove, we report. That's what we do. Except right now, nobody here wants to do any of that except me. sighs Can we have the room for a minute? sighs What has happened to you? Are you me? Yes, you. The you that I grew up with. The you that is my best friend. The you that became The Flash. I haven't seen that you in a very long time. A lot's changed, Iris. Yeah, it sure has. You have learned how to not trust people. What is it about Jay that you don't like? I don't know. Sighs It's because he reminds you of Harrison Wells. I trusted that man. For months. We all did. poignant music And you know what? Eddie is dead. Ronnie is dead. And a whole lot of other people in this city, they are dead because we trusted him. I'm not gonna let us make that mistake again. Barry, not everyone is Harrison Wells. Besides, you defeated him because you trusted in people. Because you believed in them. This team that you have here, they will follow your lead. They'll do what you say. But if they think that you don't believe in them, it won't be long before they don't believe in you.   Get to walking. I don't want to see your ugly mug around here again. Sayonara. We didn't have probable cause. I get it. One thing you should know about dealing with these metahumans, nothing is ever as it seems. Speaking of which, you're the only person here who wants to be on my task force. You want to tell me why you're so hellbent on being on it? You want to tell me why you're so hellbent I'm not? Didn't I just tell you I didn't want to see your ugly mug around here again? Well, you're gonna have to, Detective West. So I can get to the Flash. dramatic music grunts    grunts  Hey! gunfire   I like you. You'll do the trick just fine. Finally come to your senses? Sand Demon kidnapped a police officer. A woman that I know. And you need my help? I need you to help us save her. Before something happens. I guess you're gonna have to trust me now, huh, kid? laughs softly We're looking for any structures that promote humidity. Greenhouses, grow rooms, anything of the sort. His body will literally start to fall apart if he becomes dehydrated.  Like dry sand.  Exactly. Sand Demon always attacks on two fronts. He creates a diversion, then strikes when you're distracted. Okay, then what do we do? We use your speed to get to him before the distraction can happen. Jay, how do I stop somebody who can slip through my fingers? The way I was never able to. With lightning. Yo, are you about to pull a Zeus right now? What are you talking about? Barry's gonna hurl lightning from the energy he creates when he runs. Because lightning plus sand equals Glass. Time to learn something new, kid. laughs softly All right. Choo! chuckles Give me a sec. Hey, are you good? That was Singh. CCPD still hasn't found anything yet. Irony is, I didn't want Patty to have anything to do with the damn task force in the first place. And she gets taken because of me. No, no, no, this isn't your fault, all right? It's hard not to think that. Well, look, we're gonna find Patty, all right? Whatever it takes. sighs water dripping dark music   Flash is coming for you, you know? Yes, I'm sure he is. You can't beat him. I don't care what powers you have. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Is that why you need to build that concussive bomb? Yeah, I know what it is. I'm a cop. I've seen one before. This isn't gonna kill the Flash. I am. This is gonna kill you.   You know you got lucky, right? You think you were chosen. The rest of us don't mean anything. But it's not true. You were just at the right place at the right time. Getting those powers didn't change who you are. They only highlighted the worst parts of who you already were. Maybe you're right. Maybe not. Either way, you and the Flash are about to find out what those worst parts are.   beeping I've searched all the vacant buildings in Central City and none of them fit the description that we need. And I've looked at any draw upticks on the electrical grid. Nothing out of the norm, I'm afraid. We gotta do whatever it takes. I'll be back. Okay, come on. tense music   Flash is coming for you, you know? Yes, I'm sure he is. You can't beat him. I don't care what powers you have. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Oh, no. heavy breathing Mr. Ramon? What are you doing down here? I figured out where Patty is. And how exactly did you do that? Just a hunch. We gotta tell Barry. dramatic music   Again. panting I've been doing this for an hour. It's not working. It's because you're trying to rush it. This is the one time you need to slow down. Let the energy pass over you, then simply direct it to where you want it to go. All right, Jay I don't know if I'm gonna get this in time. You'll get it. I believe in you. The last person that helped me like this was a man that I looked up to. Idolized. He taught me how to get faster, how to get stronger, how to use my powers to save people. That same man murdered my mother. tense music It's a tough break, but I'm not him. Yeah. I know where they are! panting The abandoned Woodrue grow house. That's where Slick's keeping Patty. Dude, great job. And I was thinking, if I were Sand Demon and I were attacking a speedster on two fronts, I would probably want to slow you down, like, by using a concussive bomb  or something like that.  That's a good thought. He's actually used one on me before. His body absorbs the blast so it doesn't affect him. Well, kid, gonna have to think of something. You know what? What if we give Slick a diversion? He knows you, right? You said you went up against him. Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed. He doesn't know that. You got your suit? Sure. Well, except my helmet.  Helmet?  Silver kettle helmet? Gold wings? Don't tell me you guys found it. chuckles dramatic music   Never thought I'd see that again. laughs softly   It was my father's, from the War of the Americas. Did you just say War of the Americas? I wish you would have just told us you lost your helmet. Would have saved us all a headache. heroic music   Well, sure you want to do this, Flash? Yeah. Let's go see what you're made of Flash.   whirring and beeping dark music   I'm in the security feed. Go, Barry!   Is that you, Flash? Found your way here. heroic music I came quite a distance. I thought you were dead. You were wrong. Like usual. stirring music Let the girl go. Have at it. But you touch her, she goes boom. And I think even you aren't fast enough to save her.   Quite a bit slower on this Earth, aren't you, Flash? grunting coughing You don't have your speed, do you? Slick's distracted. Go, Barry. dramatic music   exploding   grunts  Jay!  Barry! suspenseful music   Patty's alive. Must be my lucky day. Zoom sent me here to kill you. Now I get to kill The Flash from two worlds before I go home. choking He's choking Jay. Barry, you gotta do something now.   Come on!   Aah! electricity sparking grunts shattering panting rousing music   You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Nice shot, kid.   Flash? Both: Coming.   Pretty good at this. chuckles I've had a lot of practice over the last year. Mm. It was really courageous doing what you did today, standing up to the Sand Demon without any powers. Ah, Barry did all the work. I just stood there and took a few punches. It was more than a few. This is a lot harder than I thought. Losing something that was such a big part of who I was for so long. I lost something that was a part of me, too. It's hard, but it gets easier every day. sentimental music You just have to find a new way to live. Just because it's a different life it doesn't mean it's a worse one.   And, speed or no speed, in my book you were still a hero today. I'm just sorry we didn't all realize it a little bit sooner. Especially me. I'll leave you two speedsters alone. laughs softly So, I hear they call you "The Scarlet Speedster"  Yeah.  chuckles  What about you?  "Crimson Comet."  Mm.  What is it with alliteration and nicknames? laughs softly Hey, look, Jay, um So, thank you for all your help. And for being so patient with me. Nah, anytime, kid. You're a quick study. Took me a lot longer to learn how to toss lightning, believe me. Then I suppose I had the right teacher. It's going to be a lot harder to take down Zoom. Who is this guy? No one knows. He showed up around the same time as when I got my powers. Killed a lot of people in my world. I spent about two years tracking him down. But he was too smart, too quick. He's always one step ahead. You really think he's just bringing these guys here to kill me? Zoom is obsessed with destroying me.  Now he wants to destroy you.  Yeah. He needs to be the best. And he will do whatever it takes to ensure he's the only speedster. In any world.  Officer Spivot?  Detective. You're supposed to be home resting. I'm okay, sir, really. Look, I'm sorry you got mixed up in all this mess because of me. It's not your fault. Do you really think you have what it takes to be part of my task force? I know it, sir. Well, I always check the jacket of anyone I'm considering for it. In my research on you, I found out we got a mutual acquaintance. Mark Mardon. I need you to be honest with me here. Why do you want to do this? Mark Mardon killed my dad. dark music He had a little shoe shop down on Chesterfield. It was a cash business. One night he went to Fairfield bank to make his weekly deposit, and the Mardon brothers showed up. While he was waiting in line, Mark shot my dad in the face for a few hundred dollars.   Then a few months later, Mark and his brother got powers. Two murderers got superpowers. So that's why I'm here, Sir. That's why I'm so hellbent on being on your task force. 'Cause there's some bad people out there and they can do anything. And I may not have powers, but I want to stop them. You're the only person I know who wants to do that, too.   Monday, 8:00 a.m. Don't be late. Uh, late for what? The task force, Detective. rousing music   laughs softly elevator bell dings Joseph. Hi. Been a long time. Yeah, it has. Why are you here? Because you didn't return my calls. And I wanted to see you. And our daughter. tense music beeping Any progress with the electrophotography? The satellite picture of the city's still rendering. typing While we wait, care to tell me what's going on with you? What? Nothing. computer beeps Two hunches in one day. Slick's locale, and that he'd be using a concussive bomb to thwart Barry. Do I need to inform you of the odds of such a prediction? dark music Something's happening to me. I'm starting to perceive things. Horrible things. It started after Wells killed me in the other timeline. It came back when Atom Smasher attacked on Flash Day, and then again when Sand Demon showed up. I get a vibe, and then a vision of something that's already happened, and then it's gone.   That's how I knew where Slick was. Cisco, this is amazing. We we have to study this, figure out just what to do. No, no, no, we're not doing any of that, and we're certainly not telling anybody, either. Cisco, I would think you'd be the one most intrigued with knowing exactly what this is and how it works. I'm seeing things I don't want to see. And knowing things I don't want to know. I just want it to stop. Professor, I don't want anyone to know about this. Not yet.   It's okay to be afraid, you know? Wells told me this was my future. That he gave me this power. But everything he did was evil. That's what scares me, Professor. You have to promise me you won't tell anyone about this. I promise. beeping Oh, wow. It appears that while we were indeed successful in closing the singularity, there was an unfortunate side effect.  What are you talking about?  Using electrophotography, Cisco and I were able to search Central City for any signs of energy entering our Earth from another dimension. From any "breaches", as Mr. Garrick described them. But, of course, there isn't just one breach. There's 52 of them scattered throughout the city. These breaches are pockets of time and space folded into and upon itself. But the most significant breach of all appears to be this one. computer beeping And where exactly is that located? It's here, inside S.T.A.R. Labs. And just beyond that breach is an entirely diff fferent thuds Professor? Professor! dramatic music I'd like to personally welcome you to the Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories, or, as it's more commonly known, S.T.A.R. Labs. Founded in 1991, S.T.A.R. Labs is leading the world in exciting new technological discoveries that, as our motto suggests, are truly bringing us tomorrow's world today. Specializing in artificial intelligence, genetics, and metahuman stu Oh, are we in for an unexpected treat. It is my absolute honor to introduce you to the founder of S.T.A.R. Labs, the savior of Central City, Dr. Harrison Wells. applause dramatic music   Hello, kids.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other metahumans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on "The Flash" How come you haven't given me a code name? What do you think I should be called? Golden Glider. Smart is sexy, Cisco. Why didn't you just kill me? Well, I guess you owe me one now too. My name is Jay Garrick. Where I came from, I was a speedster, like you. When you created the Singularity above Central City, you also created a portal connecting our two earths. I somehow ended up in your world. There isn't just one breach. There's 52 of them. But the most significant breach of all appears to be here, inside S.T.A.R. labs. Hey, Iris. What's up? Barry, I need your help, now!  Were those gunshots?  Yeah. I'm at Baldwin Tower! I can't find a way out. Window is there window? Over here! Um, yeah, up ahead. Okay, I'm by the window. Why? Okay, great, you're gonna need to jump. What? Are you crazy? Barry, no way. Iris! Do you trust me? Yes. I trust you. Okay, then jump. I can do this. I can do this.  All right. You good?  Yeah. All right. Wait, uh how many guys are up there? Uh, two. They both have guns. Okay. Okay, now they're taking little naps till the CCPD wakes them. So what exactly were you thinking? I got a hot lead on a real estate scam. I mean, these guys have been illegally evicting people, breaking up families. Okay, look, no story is worth your life. Thank you for coming! Yeah. I can't wait to write about this. Pretty amazing, isn't it? Still can't believe what I'm looking at. and the biggest one just happens to be in our basement.  We need a name for it.  It's not a pet, Cisco. No, it's a wormhole. Professor Stein, what are you doing? Your blood pressure is 147 over 82! You could pass out again. Oh, it's merely a few points above the 140 average for someone my age. Besides, I have some ideas I would like to contribute to this discussion, Dr. Snow. And I want to hear them. This isn't just a wormhole. It's my way home. Back to Earth Two. Jay, you really think that we can use this as some kind of bridge from your world to ours? Zoom uses the breaches. Why can't we? We don't know how. Everything I put through just bounces back. If Zoom's using these breaches to transport people from Earth Two, maybe it takes a speedster.  He's not gonna  Yeah, he is. Maybe I'm not fast enough. I don't believe your speed is the entirety of the issue, Barry. It might be the breach's stability  or lack thereof.  He's right. We need to think of the breach as a door, and on Earth Two, there's another door. In between, we have a hallway, but the hallway's constantly shifting, twisting, collapsing upon itself. And the doors keep moving with it. So we stabilize the door, we stabilize the hallway. And then I can jump through it. Exactly, it would serve as a kind of cannon. A speed cannon. Mm. We should hang out more. All right. No more tests today. All of you are leaving now, as am I. Cherish the gift of youth as I will go cherish my much needed nap. Clarissa's already on her way to pick me up. Joseph. You're wearing your wedding ring. Divorced men take them off. Widowers don't. I need you to leave town. And you thought you could pay me to walk away from my own daughter? Last time, you walked away for free. No amount of money is gonna keep me away from Iris. It has been 20 years, Francine. Why did you show up now? Now I'm different. Now I'm ready. No. Now you're too late. Iris is fine without you. You've done You've done a wonderful job, Joe. Better than I ever could, but right now, she needs her mother. Losing the love of your life isn't something you can just get over in a few months. I would know. Would you? You have 48 hours to leave Central City. I'm not going anywhere.  Oh!  Hey. Hey! Hey! The Flash! What? The drinks that they're serving today. They're called "The Flash." A brewed coffee with an extra shot of espresso to keep you running all day. But you should maybe just, you know, have one of those. Uh, yeah, no, my my friends, uh, ordered these. I didn't even realize Um, are you sticking around to celebrate? I don't know, should I? You know, actually, never mind, I can't. I have to head into work.  Okay.  But it was great to see you.  Yeah, good to see you.  Okay, bye. Bye, Patty.  All right, four Flashes.  Mmhmm. Be careful apparently, they are supercaffeinated. First I have a day named after me. Now I have a drink. Well, all the things you do, rebuilding this place, protecting people everyone's appreciative, right?  Mmhmm, I'll drink to that.  Yeah. Hey, you guys think Professor Stein is okay, right? I mean, Clarissa would call if there was anything wrong.  Yeah.  All right. I'm just gonna call and check in.  I'll be back.  Uh I don't see that call going well. Young lady, these repeated intrusions are interrupting what should be a speedy recov Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. You can bump into me any day, Cisco. Lisa Snart. You here to doublecross us again, or are you and your big bro holding up coffee shops now? I need your help. In your dreams, Sister Cold. You know I could call The Flash. He'd be here in like two seconds Probably one. Call him. Oh, okay. I'm gonna call him. Mmhmm. You really want me to call The Flash? I need his help too. My brother's been kidnapped. All right, so you really want us to just believe that Captain Cold was kidnapped?  I saw it happen.  Mmhmm. Last night, Lenny, me, and Mick were knocking over the cashier's cage at Central City Racetrack. Does it physically pain your family not to rob people? I never finished the job. After Mick torched through the side entrance, I looked back for Lenny and saw him getting thrown into the back of a van. And why didn't you and Mick follow? I would have. Someone hit me from behind and knocked me out. When I came to, Lenny was gone, and Mick already made off with the cash. How do we know this isn't some kind of a trap? If Lenny wanted Flash dead, he would have let Mardon, Simmons, and Bivolo take that honor, remember?  Yeah, I remember.  Good. Then you'll also recall that you owe Lenny a favor for saving your life. Time to make good on that debt, Flash. I do not like her. Yeah, but she makes a point. What? We should at least hear her out. Right? Even if I wanted to help, how are we supposed to find him? Not a problem. See, when I rebuilt the cold gun, I didn't have time to place a tracker on it, so I devised a method of locating it by borrowing some military technology. See, the gun works the same as thermal imaging, only instead of infrared heat signatures, it's looking for ultraviolet cold signatures. Whoa, look at that. The gun's UV thermal reading was last picked up at 5th and Hoyt eight minutes ago. All right. Let's see if you're a liar. Snart. Barry. Are you okay? Peachy. Okay. Uh, I'm supposed to be here to rescue you. That's not necessary. You can speed along now. Look, Snart, if these guys are making you do this No one makes me do anything. Then why does your sister think you've been kidnapped? What's taking so long? I got held up. Always the excuse with you. Look at that. I didn't think you had it in you, son. Thanks, Dad. Come on. We're behind schedule. You know what they say. "Live fast, die young." Talk to me. What's going on? Cisco! Snart hit me with his cold gun. His vitals are bottoming out! I'm bringing the heat right now. What? The suit. What's happening? Thermathreading, baby. It's a little something I added for situations exactly like this one. Please, please tell me it's working. Yeah, it works, but Snart's gone, and Lisa has a lot of explaining to do. So your brother was not kidnapped. He was pulling a job with your father. What? No, Lenny would never do that. Oh, just like he would never try and kill The Flash with his cold gun. Are you sure it was my dad?  That's him.  Lewis Snart. Convicted of larceny, armed robbery, aggravated assault, assault with a deadly weapon. You have to believe me. Lenny would never work with him. He's a bad guy. You and your entire family are criminals. Why should we trust anything you say? I didn't get this scar being a criminal. I got it being a daughter. Let me go. I got this. I see you found my hiding spot. This is usually where I come to, you know, get away. First time my father came after me, I was seven. Second time, I was eight. That's when I learned that a bottle hurts worse than a fist. He used to say he was trying to teach us lessons. I must have been a slow learner, because the lessons never stopped. I'm sorry, Lisa. Lenny practically raised me. If it weren't for him, I would have turned out a lot worse. I know, how could I be any worse? I didn't say that. You didn't have to. But believe me, there is worse. And, look, he may be a jerk brother, but he's the only jerk brother I've got. He protected me. Now it's my turn. If he's with my dad, he is in serious trouble. Please. You've gotta find out what's going on. Hey, baby. Dad! What are you doing here? Came to check in on my favorite crimefighting reporter. Dad! Actually, there's something I need to talk to you about. Hey, Iris. Editorial needs your photos and story ASAP. Congratulations, Detective. Your daughter's exposÃ© just made the front page. What? I am so happy for you. A little bit jealous, but I'll get over it. Thanks, Linda. I got lucky. No, she's being modest. Your daughter's a serious badass. You don't have to tell me. Well, better let you get back to work. Wait, there was something that you wanted to talk to me about, right? Later, it can wait. Go be fabulous. Okay. Back from the dead so soon, Barry? Pass me the salt. Don't spill. It's bad luck. Why are you working with Lewis? Lisa told us you hate him. Things are complicated with family, as you know with your own parents, hmm? Tell me what's going on. Let me help you. Don't waste your time trying to save people who don't want to be saved. Yeah, well, maybe it's not just about you, all right? I'm betting whatever you two are up to, innocent people are gonna get hurt. Don't worry, I remember our deal. You leave me alone, I make sure no one dies. All right. You're a criminal, Snart, but you live by a code. It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't, like he won't care if people die. That's why I can't leave this alone. Then everyone will know who The Flash is under that mask. I don't care. I will take you down anyway. Both of you. We'll see about that. Thanks for dinner. Mmhmm. Iris' mom is alive. I lied to Iris, you, everybody. Why? I felt like I didn't have a choice. Francine did so many things wrong. Just about everything. I don't know. Now I feel like my one wrong might be worse. Look, Joe. I've known you for, you know, most of my life, and I know that you always have a good reason for the decisions you make. And obviously, you were worried that Iris would go down the wrong path if Francine raised her. Look at Snart. He's a criminal because he had Lewis for a father. That could have been me. Oh, come on. Never. Yeah, because I had you. And so did Iris. You just gotta trust in that and tell her the truth. Yeah, how do I do that without hurting her? She's not a little girl anymore. You should have seen her in action the other day, putting her neck on the line for a story. She can handle anything that comes her way. I just lied to her for so long, I'm scared she's not gonna understand or forgive me. I could lose her. No, she's gonna forgive you. You just gotta give her a chance. We make our move at 9:00. That's when the cleaning crews go in and the daytime shift leaves. Now we'll go up in the service elevator to the 27th floor. They got a twoman team of armed guards working the 27th through 29th floor, but if we time it perfectly with their shift change, we should be able to get in and out. And if the timing doesn't work out? Then those guards don't make it home. But if we start on the top floor, there's a service elevator that will Son, you and I both know that there's casualties in this line of work. Rutenberg, you're the tech guy. Did you find a solution for the vault hallway? Not yet. That Draycon Systems keypad's gonna be a problem. Fine. How about you? You gonna disappoint me too, or is that freeze gun of yours gonna look after the power source for the laser grid? It's a cold gun, and yes, but I have a better way to get past the lasers. That gun is the only reason you're here, so shut up before I make you Ow! Ow, my my head. Oh! My head! Aah! Feels like it's gonna Nobody talks to my son that way. Nobody. Don't worry, sir. I waited for you this time. Okay, I may have done a quick preliminary assessment of my own. Something is definitely weird.  Oh.  Decapitation.  Yeah.  Yikes. We're still recovering parts of the head, so the ID is taking a little longer than normal. Aah! Ugh. Sorry, I thought I stepped on an ear. I didn't. If I did, I'd be hearing things. Oh, hell no. Doesn't look like the head was sliced off with any weapon I'm familiar with, and I'm familiar with most weapons. Yeah, you're right. Perforation around the neck it's too jagged. It's almost like the head was blown off. Like a metahuman who can explode heads, right? Not necessarily. Traces of thermite.  Bomb residue?  Uhhuh. But then why wasn't the rest of the body blown apart?  I don't know.  The victim is David Rutenberg, security systems expert, and guess who's on his list  of known associates.  Hmm?  Lewis Snart.  Lewis Snart. Isn't he related to Leonard Snart, aka Captain Cold?  Please don't call him that.  Okay.  Uh, one second.  Sure. Come here. I think this guy is part of Snart's crew. So Snart put a bomb in him to keep him in line? No, Snart wouldn't do that, but his father would. So Lewis is killing people, and Snart's still working with him? What happened with the deal you had? Maybe he doesn't have a choice. So you think Lewis put a bomb in his own son to force him to pull off a heist? Snart still wouldn't do it. He'd dig the bomb out of his own head if he had to. So it must be something else that Snart cares about. The only thing Snart cares about is his sister.  Hey.  Hey. Thought you might be hungry. Ah, good to know whatever Earth you go to, there's always a Big Belly Burger. Thank you very much. Looks like you're making progress. Slowly. Should be able to do this a lot faster. You miss it, your speed? Yeah. Surprising how much. So what will you do when you go back to your Earth? I don't know. Guess I'll just have to get used to being Normal? Yeah. Two years ago, I was just a scientist slowly trying to save the world by purifying heavy water without residual radiation. Important work. Yeah, it was, but after the Particle Accelerator exploded, I didn't need to wait years for my research to save a life, I could save one before breakfast. I could save 50 before going to sleep. There's nothing like that rush. You guys have been fighting so many battles, one after another, I'm not sure Barry's had time to take it in, to appreciate how great it can feel. Being a superhero isn't always about how fast you can run. It's about helping however you can, wherever you're needed most. I think that Jay Garrick, physicist, has just as much to contribute as Jay Garrick, superhero. Maybe more. You know what would help me build the speed cannon faster?  Hmm?  An extra set of hands. Specifically ones with a surgeon's precision. Me? Sure, if you think I can really help. Hey, Caitlin? We need you up here, like, right now. Sorry. Oh, boy. What is it? Lisa, there are traces of thermite on your skin. Thermite? Like an explosive? Not like an explosive. It's a bomb. When you were knocked out, your dad must have injected you with it. Hey, Dad, what's up? Your message was pretty cryptic, even for you. Hey, baby, I need you to sit down. Dad, what's going on? Okay. When I was still a beat cop, me and my partner were on patrol, and dispatch came on the radio. A little girl had called in. She said her mom had taken some pills and she wouldn't wake up. And the little girl gave the address. The address was mine. By the time I got here, your mother was unresponsive. Passed out on the couch. And in the kitchen, the stove was on. There you were, standing in front of an open flame. If I hadn't gotten here when I did  Wait, my mom  Your mom was a drug addict. This wasn't the first time something like that had happened. I got Francine into another rehab, and a couple days later, she was gone. I looked everywhere for her, but wife of a cop, she knew how to disappear. I couldn't stand the thought of you growing up thinking you were abandoned. Going to sleep at night thinking your mother left because you weren't enough to make her stay, that you weren't loved, because I loved you. I loved you with everything I got. Then we took Barry in, and I saw the trauma he was going through and I I was sure. I was sure that I did the right thing. Not giving you that burden. What do you mean "Mom left"? I I don't I don't understand. I don't understand. What are you telling me? Your mother's alive. She's here in Central City. She wants to see you. All these years, I thought Daddy, you told me that my I know. I should have told you sooner, but I couldn't figure out the right way. The mother you thought you remember the perfect mother and the stories I made up for you that is the mother you deserve, and I knew Francine couldn't be like that. She would only break your heart. I'm so sorry. Dad It's okay. I understand. You were just trying to keep me safe. The microbomb casing must be made of some kind of a ferromagnetic material. Once you hold it steady with the magnet, I can surgically excise it. Put the magnet down! This is a really concentrated bomb. It's gonna combust if it's exposed to magnetic friction and an oxidant. What's he talking about? Air. Uh, the bomb will explode if it comes in contact with air. Don't worry, Lisa. We're gonna find another way to get it out. Scientific minds. Can we confer, please. What if Flash speed extracts it? Nope, it's too risky. I'm gonna find a way to get it out. I just need a little time. Well, we need to keep track of Lewis until you figure out how to disarm the bomb. I wish we knew what he was gonna steal next and when. Maybe I can get them to tell me. Their tech guy is dead, so I'm betting they're gonna need a new one. I'm saying I'm gonna infiltrate Lewis' crew. You're gonna pretend to be a criminal? How hard can it be? These visits are getting old. Third time's a charm. I told you, I don't need saving. But your sister does. I know your dad put a bomb in Lisa. Lewis told you he'd kill her if you didn't help him, right? Look don't worry. My team's working on a way to remove the bomb. I hope you got that gun of yours ready to blast 'cause Who the hell's this? Um, Lenny said you needed new tech. What's up, I'm Sam, so Heh! You tellin' me you think this kid can crack a Draycon keypad? Uh, I did help Snart steal the Kahndaq Dynasty Diamond from Central City Museum last year. That was locked up behind an AmerTek Industries Phase Three Suppression Door with a Draycon XL1218 keypad. So Couldn't have done it without him. Draycon's my jam. Ah. Okay, Sam. Let's go. Right now? You got a problem with that? No, all good. Can't wait. Oh, this should be fun. Keep quiet and follow my lead. Just like old times. You watching the Diamonds' game? Yeah, the Salamanders are killing 'em. IDs. What floor are you going to? Hey, what's the hold up, guys? I mean, you wanna call management and explain why the toilets are still overflowing? We're all on the clock, right? Yeah, you guys are good to go. Thanks. You enjoy the game, guys. Diamonds don't stand a chance. Not tonight they don't. Hold on. Did you hear that? I got it. It's two armed guards. Guess your timing didn't work out after all. Yeah, that's why I got a Plan B. 'Cause you always needed one. Yeah, but your sister turned out to be a disappointment also. All right, what do you guys say we get on with the job? Guards are gone. Must have taken a break. Yeah, must have. Okay, Sam. Show us what you got. Yeah, all right. Gonna just You guys just keep a lookout and I'll Boom! Told you Draycon was my jam.  Nice job, Sam.  Yeah. It's good to go out on a high note. I'm sorry, Barry. What are you gonna do to me with that thing? Operating pressure on this is over 1,000 PSI. This will easily suck the microbomb out of her neck and into the barrel of this with one highpowered shot. There is one slight risk. Besides shooting a highpowered weapon directly against my neck? The gun does use compressed air. I trust you, Cisco. Okay, son. Make me proud. Like I care. Ha, now what? I told you, I had a better way past the lasers. Step aside. Time for another lesson. You've got 125 seconds before the system defrosts.  Then what?  Sirens. How do you feel? Like we should have put down some plastic. It's not funny. Yeah but I like it when you smile. Okay, ready? Shoot me, Cisco. It's d Flash! Cisco, how's it going with Lisa? Uh, kind of in the middle of it right now, buddy! All right, we need that bomb out. The heist is going down right now. Time's up. Let's get out of here. Only place you're going is back to Iron Heights, Lewis.  Ah, you wanna bet?  Do I wanna bet? Do not bet! Give me a minute. Tell me this, what kind of man puts a bomb in his own daughter? A very rich man. Shoot him, son. Kill him or you'll never see your sister alive. Do it, Cisco. I got the bomb out! Lisa's safe. Aah! You're working with The Flash? I thought you hated him? Not as much as I hate you. Lisa was safe. Why did you do that? He broke my sister's heart. Only fair I break his. Last time I was in Iron Heights,  I was visiting my Dad.  Yeah, me too.  And yet you killed him.  He deserved it.  Is that funny to you?  No. What's funny is I finally figured out your secret. And what secret would that be? You'd do anything to protect your sister. Well, I know your secret too. Better hope I don't talk in my sleep. You won't. Today just proved what I've always known. There's good in you, Snart. And you don't have to admit it to me, but there's a part of you that knows you don't have to let your past define you. A part of you that really wants to be more than just a criminal. So I should be a hero like you, Barry? What exactly does that pay again? It's just a matter of time. Something you'll have a lot of in here. Not as much as you think. Be seeing you. You really think that leopard's gonna change its spots? I do. Maybe we should transfer him to the metahuman wing anyway. I already got Patty on the paperwork. Hey, I wanted to thank you for the advice you gave. I told Iris. She's gonna sit down with Francine. It was hard, but it was for the best. I'm glad. Any time.  You're a good son, Barry.  I know. Thank you. Fancy seeing you here. We have to stop running into each other like this. I know, we should just make a schedule or something. Okay, great. Well, then I'll just have, you know, my people call your people. See, that's the problem. Neither one of us have people. So how are we possibly gonna do this?  There. My number.  Oh! That's what you meant, right? Yes, it  No.  Yea I No you didn't. Um, you know what, though? I've actually been meaning to give you my number in case you had questions about a case. You know, sometimes when you call through dispatch,  it gets all jammed up  Mmhmm. And this is efficient. And as law enforcement colleagues,  efficiency is important.  Yes, it is. No, that's a yeah That's exactly what I was thinking too. 'Kay, great. Awesome.  Mmhmm.  Okay, I'll see you. Yeah. Oh! Ope! Just kidding. Okay. Thanks. Yep. So, taking off? Thought I'd say goodbye and thank you. Yeah, well, I wouldn't leave a bomb in anyone.  Not even you.  It's more than that. You were there for me when I was feeling weak. I hate feeling weak. It's hard for me to trust people. I trusted you. You know, you might actually be my first real friend. Is any of that true? Till next time, Cisco. Later, Golden Glider. Tada! The speed cannon. Wow! Look at that. Dudes, you actually built the thing. Mr. Garrick, I am quite impressed by what you've accomplished during my recent wellness hiatus.  Have you tested it out yet?  Not yet. You wanna do the honors? No, no, no, no. Now that I, uh now that I am back to optimum health, Please allow me. Excelsior!  How did you stabilize it?  CFL Quark Matter. Ah, negative energy density with positive surface pressure. It's genius. You created CFL Quark Matter? It's something we perfected on my Earth. I'll show you sometime. You mean, sometime in the next few minutes? Oh, yeah I guess this is it, huh?  Time for me to go back home.  Right now? I mean we still need your help with the Breachers. My first priority is Zoom. I need to find out what he's up to. How he stole my speed. But you can do that here and, you know, if you go back, then we can't get in touch with you when we need your help or with Zoom or whatever else. It would be nice to be able to pick your brain every once in a while, get some more speedster tips. Okay Once we take care of Zoom,  I'm going home.  That's fair. Good, 'cause I could use a shower, a shave, and some sunlight. I'll, uh, see you later. So, Professor Stein, how are you feeling? Well, uh, it appears that a little rest heals all maladies. I I couldn't feel  Professor?  No, no, no, no get back. Come here. Professor Stein! Professor Stein! Can you hear me, Professor Stein? What happened to him? He went up like Firestorm, but the flame, why was it blue? I don't know. This isn't good. We need to stabilize him fast.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other metahumans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Iris: Previously on "The Flash" Iris's mom is alive. And you thought you could pay me to walk away from my own daughter. Last time you walked away for free. When you created the singularity, you also created a breach a portal connecting our two earths. You really think he's just bringing these guys here to kill me? Zoom is obsessed with destroying me. Now he wants to destroy you. I'm starting to perceive thingshorrible things. We have to merge the inner and outer event horizons by separating in the eye of it. No! exciting music Ronnie died saving me, and I'm so sorry. No, no, no, get back. Come here. gasping Professor Stein, can you hear me? Barry: Everyone secretly thinks they've figured out what their life is gonna be like, but what no one ever considers is that life has its own plans for you, whether you like them or not. And so you're left with a choice. You can either embrace the change and move forward, or fight it, and be left behind. Dude! I knew you could do it. chuckles That was some touchdown, man. You won us the game! Hey, no, man. We won us the game. Hey, that's not what the cheerleaders were saying. laughter Oh, yeah? For real? A'ight. Jefferson, great game. Hey, thanks, coach. I'm not the only one that noticed. Lot of scouts in the stands tonight, and after that touchdown, they all pulled out their cell phones. You're gonna get your pick of colleges, son. You really think so? I know so. You get home and celebrate with your mom. dark music   Everybody, run! people yelling Oh! people shouting Hey, hey, come on, man, I got you! We gotta get inside the tunnel!   Ugh! Aah! Hold him steady! He's dropping out. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Cisco, we're losing him! Got it! dramatic music Oh, Dios mio. Thank God. He's getting worse. Look, I did what I could to reengineer Doctor Wells's original stabilizer to quell the reaction, but I don't know what he used as a power source. Best I could find was the one from his wheelchair. And how long will that last? Well, that's the problem, is we had already used up most of its energy trying to dampen the metas' powers during our little rogue air trip with Weather Wizard and company. I think we got a few days tops. And he's stuck in bed? Yeah, when he wakes up, I'm gonna transfer the stabilizer to this, give him a power cane, get him moving. We gotta figure out a way to save him. I think I might know how to do that. When the Particle Accelerator exploded, the dark matter that collided with Professor Stein fused with the Firestorm matrix and altered the normal molecular processes that occurs within his body. Those highly reactive molecules needed something to bond with in order to stabilize. And that's where Ronnie came in. Yes, and now that Ronnie is no longer a part of Professor Stein Those molecules don't have anything to bond to. And the longer he goes without merging, the more unstable he becomes. Ugh. All right, so, what do we do? We find another participant. Okay, cool, so, how do we do that? Are we just gonna make a Tinder app for potential metahumans? 'Cause I'm pretty sure merging with Stein and randomly bursting into flames sounds like the biggest "swipe left" of all time. I mean, even if we could find someone willing, Stein can't just merge with whoever he wants. No he can't, but I have done some research, and found two potential candidates that might be compatible with him. They both were affected by the dark matter, and they were both admitted to the hospital showing symptoms of gene rearrangement mutation. And they both share the same blood type as Professor Stein and Ronnie. All right. I mean, this is more than organ donation. We'll need more than tissue typing to see if their bodies are compatible. If I can isolate the genetic locus of the two candidates and crossreference it with the mutations in Professor Stein, I might be able to find a match and save his life. What do you need to do that? rousing music   All right, blood samples from both potential candidates. Damn, that was fast even for you. I may have skipped the asking for permission part. Let's see if we can't find a match. You were two in that picture. You'd just got some shots. You were so mad at the nurse. You kept saying, "She pinched me." chuckles So we took you to the park afterwards to cheer you up, gave you your first ice cream cone, which was a mistake, because all we heard the next month was, "Mintchoplat chip, mintchoplat chip." laughs Oh, that's where the obsession started. Babe, you don't have to do this. If you don't want to meet your mother tomorrow, I get it. No, it's okay. I want to meet her. I need to meet her. It's gonna be fine. Both: Mm. My brave baby girl. Take after you. solemn music Love you. Love you more. Barry? Hey, I was just looking for you. I would've called, but I don't have your number yet, so. Oh, yeah No, no, no, I just wanted to show you this. These were just found in an alley off of Eastwood Avenue. What are these, teeth? Shark teeth. laughs And I have an eyewitness that says he saw a shark walking on landa manshark.  Manshark? laughs  Yeah. Sounds like a bad scifi movie. Or awesome scifi movie. laughs Totally. Um Are you for real? You think there's actually, like, a shark Yeah, I mean, I know it sounds really wacko  Mmhmm.  But, I mean, nothing seems impossible now that we have metahumans, right? And I thought it would be fun, you know, for us to work together again on a case. Yeah, I mean, I really I'd love to work on anything with you. Um, it's just, you know, metahumans aren't really my thing. Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine. I can handle it. No, youlook, how about I just I'll run a test, see where the teeth came from. That would be amazing.  All right, cool.  Thanks. Yeah, sure. Detective Spivot. Detective. How's your manshark case coming? It's good. I was just gonna go and canvas the area, see what else I can dig up, and Barry here agreed to run some tests for me.  Really?  Mmhmm. So, progress. Thanks again. Mmhmm. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were flirting with my partner. What, Patty? No, I'm scoffs What are you talking about? I'm not What is it with you and Iris and my partners? Hey, how is Iris, by the way? phone vibrates Eh, she's pretty nervous about seeing her mother after all these years. Yeah. Hey, you know what, I gotta go. It's Cisco. It's about Professor Stein. Okay, go. I'll cover you with Singh. All right, thanks. Well, I must admit, I never imagined the Sphinx's riddle about a man requiring three legs would ever apply to me, but if this device keeps me mobile, then I will gratefully oblige. Hopefully, you won't need it for much longer. There was no agglutination in the blood samples, and crossmatching was negative for both, and it appears that the dark matter from the Particle Accelerator explosion mutated their genes in a very similar way it did to yours. I think they're both potential matches. So who do we go with? Well, my first choice is Henry Hewitt. He graduated summa cum laude from Hudson University with a double major in Applied Physics and Bioengineering. A Hudson boy, I like him already. Now, what about this other guy Jefferson Jackson? High school quarterback, He's got the physical attributes. And it looks like more of his alleles match than Hewitt's. Doesn't that mean that he's more compatible? On paper, perhaps, but Hewitt is a scientist. Clearly, he's trying to make something of his life. I think he'd be open to something like this. I think we should meet with both of them before we make a decision. That's an excellent idea. I'll see if I can get Hewitt here. All right, in the meantime, we'll go meet with Jefferson Jackson. And I will try to find something else to help keep you stable. dark music  Anything you want   Anything you need  Are you sure this is the right place? Yeah. Jefferson's a mechanic. bell dings Could indicate a strong technical aptitude. That's a positive. Oh, prone to allergies. That's definitely a negative, not to mention his taste in music. tool clatters Would you prefer Celine Dion instead? I got the "Titanic" soundtrack in the back there. No, thank you. Jefferson Jackson, right? People call me Jax. Ooh, catchy. My name's Barry Allen, and this is Martin Stein. We're with the Department of Safety. It's a small, newly formed agency. Very new, we probably don't even have a website yet, do we? You need to see our licenses? I mean, we're all up to code here. No, no, nothing like that. We are compiling data on people who were affected by the Particle Accelerator explosion two years ago. Look, man, I lost enough time in my life 'cause of that stupid thing going wrong. Now, you don't got a car I can fix, I can't help you. If you would consider coming back to S.T.A.R. Labs with us, I believe we can help you. Help me how? Well, we know what the Particle Accelerator did Look, I already told you, I don't talk about that night. Why is that? Because that's when everything changed. I got hit hard. When I woke up, I was in the hospital. Busted up leg, torn ACL. The look on my mom's face, I knew any dreams I had of playing pro ball were over. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, well look, I gotta get back to work. Yeah, um Here, it's just it's our number. Just think about it, okay? Thank you for putting this together, Joseph. Iris's idea, not mine. Hey, baby. Hi, Dad. Iris this is Francine. Hello. Hi. Hello, Iris. Can I get you a coffee or something? Um, no, thanks. Let's just sit. I can't get over what a beautiful young woman you've become. And a journalist? I'm so proud of you. Why are you here? Why now, after two decades? I want to make this right with you. How about you start by apologizing for walking out on us? I am sorry, so very, very sorry. There's so much you don't know. I'm sure that you've been through a great deal, and I can appreciate you feeling like this is suddenly the right time for you to want me in your life, but that doesn't mean that it's the right time for me. Iris No, Dad, it's okay. I've thought about this a lot, and it wasn't fair for me to make you the bad guy. So I want you to hear this from me. I don't hate you, Francine. I do wish you well, but we have lived separate lives for over 20 years. Let's keep it that way. solemn music   laughs I've always thought my destiny was for greater things. And people, of course. Well, when it's all said and done, flying will be the least impressive of your new abilities. Man finally achieves the promise of the Atomic Age. Caitlin, what's going on? Hi, I'm glad you're back. This is Dr. Henry Hewitt. This is Barry Allen and Professor Martin Stein. How do you do? The illustrious Martin Stein. I've read all your papers back at Hudson, especially on transmutation. Fascinating.  You're a legend.  Oh, please. I think you're overestimating my contribution to the field.  II appreciate your enthusiasm.  Isn't he great? He's got an ego the size of Texas, but, yeah, he's all right. So, where's Jefferson Jackson? We just need more time. We don't have more time. I couldn't find another power source for the cane and that thing's running out. Okay, then let's do the merge. Hewitt's in. What do you mean? You told him the details of the Firestorm Matrix? Absolutely, becoming Firestorm is a huge life change. He needs to know what he's getting himself into. If I remember correctly, vector, variance, hypotenuse Proton, neutron, go H.U.! Aw, look at that, that's so cute. We'll have two Professor Steins if this works. It's gonna work. Yeah. Okay. When I put this splicer on your chest you're gonna feel a rush. That's a molecular primer being released into your body. Then you can make physical contact with Professor Stein, and whoosh Firestorm Matrix will take over. Easy enough. Ready? No time like the present. Thank you, my dear. Okay. mechanical whirring laughs exciting music   Try again. tense music   This is unexpected. Something's supposed to be happening, right? Why isn't it working? I don't know. Uh, well, looks like you two aren't compatible after all. I'm just gonna So all this was for nothing? Believe me, no one is more disappointed than I am. Yeah, don't be so sure about that. Next time, try to get your act together before you get someone's hopes up. gentle music   dark music   Move the showandtell to next Tuesday, remind me to call Richard tomorrow about the shareholders meeting, and where are we with the replacement for Doctor Snow? Uh alarm buzzing Applied sciences. alarm buzzing dramatic music   Stop! Don't move!   Harrison? Detective West, thank you for coming. Doctor McGee, this is my new partner, Detective Spivot. It's nice to meet you. I was saddened by Detective Thawne's passing. Please extend my condolences to your daughter. Thank you. On the phone you mentioned this was a sensitive matter. It is, and I called you directly because I've always appreciated your discretion in the past. Of course, can you tell me what was stolen? It's not so much what was stolen, but who stole it. The person who broke into my facility last night was Harrison Wells. gasps Harrison Wells is dead. I seem to recall the circumstances around his passing were a bit inconclusive. Is there any possibility he could be alive? Zero possibility. I knew the man for over 20 years. I know who I saw. The only thing distinctively different was he's walking again. Like I said, I trust your discretion. You have full access to the facility. Thank you again, Detective. First a sharkman, now a dead man walking. We need to call Barry, get him in here first. Barry can't hear about any of this. Whatwhy? Because he's got a lot on his plate. He's got a friend who's sick who he needs his help, and Harrison Wells is the man who murdered his mother. Once he hears that Is he okay? He's fine, but not a word to him or anyone, okay? Okay. Yeah, it's just, I'm not really good at lying. Well, you better learn, quick. Yeah, definitely. elevator bell dings Spivot, go on ahead. Sure. This is the last time you ever show up here. Do you understand? I needed to talk to you again. How much clearer do we need to be? Iris and I do not want you in our lives. Leave, please. Go home, live your life. Joe, there's something else. I wanted to tell you when I first saw you, but What is it? A few months ago, I started getting weak. The doctors ran a bunch of tests, they couldn't figure it out. But finally, they did. Said I have something called MacGregor's. Supposedly it's pretty common among exaddicts. Told me I had till the end of the year if I'm lucky. Isis that why you came back? I just want my daughter to know me this me. solemn music   I'm really glad you decided to come. I thought S.T.A.R. Labs had to shut down. It's under new management. Huh. Whoa, what kind of treadmill is that? Cosmic. laughs softly Cool. So, let's get started. You got some kind of "Billion Dollar Man" technology that gonna fix my knee? Actually, Jax, this isn't about fixing your knee. What are you talking about? When the Particle Accelerator exploded, the energy wave that collided with you is known as "dark matter." And it didn't just hurt your knee. Itit changed the molecular structure of your body. Whoa, hold on, Grey. So you're saying I'm like one of those metahumans I keep hearing about on the news? Yes, I am. Please, call me Professor. We think you have potential capabilities. What kind of capabilities? The same as Professor Stein: the ability for your body to process fission and fusion. And you can harness excess energy and turn it into these massive nuclear blasts. And you can fly. There's also that. So you're saying you can do all this? Only during times of convergence with a willing partner. Convergence? You and me? Yes. rousing music laughs No, this is crazy. No, Jax, this is your chance to right the wrong that was done to you. Yeah, sorry, you got the wrong guy. I don't want nothing to do with this. Wait a second, we are giving you the chance to be a superhero, and you're gonna say no that quickly? Yeah, not my kind of thing. If the man isn't willing to participate Look, I saw your test scores, Jax. Your grades were good enough to get into college, but you didn't go. Why? Is this the type of guy you are? One setback and you fold? Well, then maybe you're not the guy for us anyway. Well, maybe I'm not. Jack Maybe this just wasn't meant to be. Cait, come on, I mean, Jax could be our last chance at saving Professor Stein. He said no to being a superhero. Who does that? I mean, you didn't say no when you had the chance. Cisco, would you? Chance to have superpowers? Sign me up. Look, we're asking Jax to change his entire life, to sacrifice what he does have. I mean, that's not a decision that can be made lightly. It took me a long time to figure out this whole hero thing. Exactly, which is why we need someone who wants to do this. Where are you going? To get Hewitt back. We have to try again. Human DNA? Yup, definitely not a manshark. Not even a land shark, Ma'am. Well, thanks for testing it for me. Yeah. What are you gonna do now? I don't know, probably file it under "never gonna happen." I have another case anyway. Oh, anything I can help you with? No, no, no, no, Detective said definitely nnot. Is everything all good? Sure, why? laughs I don't know, you're just acting kind of different. No! No. I'm the same old P. Spivot, you know? Whatactually, I have to go, but thank you so much for testing this, and I'll see you. Okay, I laughs softly Yo, Joe. Hey. You good? Everything all right? Yeah. No, I'm just had hell of a day. Yeah? sighs Iris's mother, she told me she was dying. Yeah, and I know Francine. She's telling the truth about this. Okay. Does Iris know? Not yet. Did did you need something? Uh, no, no. I just, um Patty said you that you don't want me on some case that she's on with you. No. I was checking out a lead. I'll let you know. All right, cool. What is up with you and my partner, anyway? laughs Come on, I Bar, you can't take your eyes off that girl. I don't know what you want me to tell you. I mean, she's great, you know. She's adorable and funny and we have a lot in common, but "But, um." I don't know. She's not Iris, I guess. Right. You've known Iris since you were ten. You've been in love with her since forever. I mean, you two are friends now, but she was your first love. You're never gonna feel the same about anybody else, but you can't let that stop you from exploring something new. Yeah. And in happier news, remember Flash Day, the downtown celebration to honor Central City's one and only superhero? door closes Well, just weeks Hewitt, you have those nucleosome results? Tomorrow. I told you I needed them tonight. And I'm telling you you'll have them tomorrow. electricity sparking You know, I know you think you're smarter than everyone here, Hewitt, but I'm sick of you not doing your job, your not showing up. If I have any more trouble from you, you're done here. What, you're gonna take the test away and give it to another lab rat of yours? You're gonna report me to the board? Or maybe you're thinking of firing me? I'd like to see you try! Now get the hell out of my lab! dramatic music   What's being described as a "spontaneous energy malfunction" erupted last night at Eikmeier Technologies. Wanted for questioning is scientist Henry Hewitt. Hewitt's dormant abilities must have been triggered when we attempted the merger. This could be catastrophic. If his powers are anything like mine, he requires a grounding mechanism to stabilize his volatility. Otherwise Yeah, he's gonna pop his top, and he's got a long history of violence, according to his police record. Police record? I didn't find a police record. Yeah, of course not, it was sealed, but guess what, ya boy hacked in and hold on, wait for it. typing clacks One count battery, two counts aggravated assault, courtordered anger management therapy. He seemed like such a nice guy. He even knew your Hudson nerd song. gasping Whoa, you okay? It appears Mr. Hewitt's stability isn't the only one in question. I think I need to lie down. Yeah, I'll come with you. Thank you. Professor Stein is getting worse. And Hewitt's like this because of me. And now Jefferson Jackson will never come back because of what I said. I just didn't believe that he has what it takes. This isn't because you didn't believe in him. chuckles Sometimes, great possibilities are right in front of us, and we don't see them, because we choose not to. I think that we need to be open to exploring something new. poignant music   She's dying? A few months left. I just don't think I can see her, Dad. And that's fine. But you and me need to be crystal clear about this, Iris. If you want to have a relationship with Francine, it's okay with me. You don't have to protect me. I'm a grown man and I've dealt with these feelings a long time ago. sighs So youyou just believe her? She's done some bad things in her life, but she wouldn't lie about this. Dad, she shows up out of nowhere, and only says that she's dying after I told her to stay away. Look, she didn't come to Central City to see me. She came because of you. I just wanted you to know everything so you can make the best decision for yourself. I mean, she is still your mother. Either way, whatever you decide, just know, I got your back.   I know. sighs Let me guess, you don't got car troubles. I came to apologize. I'm sorry for what I said. It's fine. Apology accepted. Look, we could really use your help to save Professor Stein. chuckles That desperate, huh? Yes.  sighs  My husband, Ronnie, he used to be Professor Stein's other half. He actually helped build the Particle Accelerator, and when it exploded, he was affected by it too. Ironically, that's how he got the chance to show the world what he was truly capable of. And he died saving this city. Wait, he was the guy that flew into the black hole? That was him? He was a hero. You can be one too. I never wanted to be a hero. What I wanted was to go to college, but we couldn't afford it. Football was my way in, until that got taken from me. I know. Look, I know the Particle Accelerator took something from you. But it also gave you something in return, something even more spectacular, the opportunity to be part of something bigger, to be part of a team that's working to protect people from losing what you lost. stirring music I believe you were meant to be a hero.   electricity sparking Whoa, hold on. I've been looking for you, Dr. Snow. Hey, look, man, we're ugh! gasps suspenseful music You did this to me! But it's not what you promised, is it? Is it? Come on!   Where to? S.T.A.R. Labs.   Caitlin.  What's wrong?  Come here. Oh, good, you're here. This thing, it ran out, like, 30 minutes ago. His temperature is 142 degrees and rising fast. He's going into rapid oxidation. We need to find a coolant. I think it's too late for that. I'll do it. I'll merge with him. You said this is a chance for me to be a part of something bigger than myself, to help people. That's what I want. You're sure? Once you merge, there's no going back on this. And you said I could fly, right?  Damn right.  Okay. So what do I do? Okay, well, here's the abridged version.  Professor Stein?  groans  Professor Stein?  Clarissa, five more minutes. No, Professor, you have to get up. Jax is here.  Yeah.  What?  Jax is here.  What?  Here, grab onto me.  Jax? Yeah. tense music This is it.   device whirring Whew.   You came back, Jefferson, thank you. Well, like my coach always said, "Out of yourself and into the team." So, how's this work?

Professor Stein: Move, now! Calm down, Jefferson, focus. Use your natural athleticism to gain control. Hey, you okay? I was a quarterback. I know how to take a hit. Hey, guys, cutting the power didn't work. It's like the more we anger him, the stronger he gets. That's it, it's like one of those, uh, controlled fusion devices. Um Tokamak? Yes, exactly, and the more powerful they become, the more unstable they become. Barry, make him angry, and he'll blow his fuse. You up for a little game of "catch me if you can?" Let's go for it. Okay. heroic music   Hey, Hewitt, over here! Paging Dr. Hewitt. Boo! Aah! Man, you are not good at this. Aah! Do you need a hug, Doctor? Aah! grunts Come on, Hewitt, give me your best shot! Now. grunting   Is that all you got, Hewitt? Man, no wonder you didn't make the cut if that's how you fight. both laughing Aah!   Not bad for your first go at this. Well, I had a great coach to help me through it. Isn't that right, Grey? Professor Stein: Despite my initial reservations, we make a pretty fantastic team. laughs Welcome aboard, Firestorm. rousing music   solemn music Hi. Thank you for coming. You have no idea what this means to me. My dad told me you were sick. You know, I wasn't sure that I could believe you, so I did some checking. Turns out you're telling the truth. I would never lie to you about something so big. Really? 'Cause I was actually thinking that I could give you another chance after hearing that news. But you're still lying, still keeping secrets. I'm an investigative reporter, Francine. I uncover things that people want to keep hidden, like having a son. Iris He was born eight months after you left Central City. Let me explain. Who's the father, Francine? Is it my dad? Do I have a brother? Wait, you know, I don't even wantI don't want to know. I mean, I wouldn't be able to tell if you were telling the truth or if it was another one of your lies, anyway. Oh. I want you to leave. You stay away from me, and you stay away from my father. If he finds out that he might have a son that grew up without even knowing him, it would crush him. Just sighs Leave us alone. Iris, I was solemn music   And how is Mr. Hewitt? Seems like that last burst of energy has burnt him out. Our Tokamak's gone dark. Yeah, we're just gonna keep him safe and sound in the pipeline till he decides to keep quiet about all this. So you're gonna meet up with Clarissa? We're meeting in Pittsburgh in three days. Why Pittsburgh? A colleague of mine was monumental in helping train Ronald and me. She's graciously offered to help the two of us as well. How's she gonna help us? Well, there were many aspects of our abilities that we never quite achieved. Hopefully now, we can fully realize that potential. Oh, my dearest Dr. Snow. Ronald may be lost to us, but he will never be forgotten. Speaking of this was Ronnie's. He always used it to find his way back home. I want you to have it. sentimental music Thank you. You know, this whole thing is strange, being 50% of someone. Yeah, but you're 100% a hero. laughs softly I went ahead and recalibrated the splicer so the merging should be even smoother now. Thank you. If I may offer a bit of parting advice. Cisco, I know you're scared, but this ability you have is a gift, not a curse. It's natural to be apprehensive about the unknown, but look at Jefferson. He took a leap, and it changed his life for the better. The very thing that makes you different is what makes you special.   Tell your friends.   And now I believe it's time to take this show on the road or to the sky, if I am to be literal. laughter stirring music sighs   Are you ready, Jefferson?   All right.  See you later.  Yeah. That was one hell of a leap of faith that kid took, merging with Professor Stein. Yeah, it was. There's a lesson in there somewhere for you. Barry: Things aren't always what they seem. Our fears can play tricks on us, making us afraid to change course, afraid to move on, but usually, hidden behind our fears are second chances waiting to be seized rousing music   Second chances at life    Whoo!  At glory Whoo!   At family   At love. And these opportunities don't come around every day, so when they do, we have to be brave, take a chance, and grab them while we can. dramatic music Zoom wants you dead.  growls  whimpers    whimpers  growls Oh, my God, it's real. Hey! Put him down! Put your hands your fins in the air! whimpers  laughs  grunts   gun clicks  electricity sparks  growls panting Who the hell are you? rousing music  My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on The Flash There is, indeed, a hole in our universe which leads to his Earth. Meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2. Do you think we've reached the good-night kiss stage? Zoom is obsessed with speed. He has been sending meta-humans from your world through the breaches to fight me. Her name is Doctor Light. Hello, gorgeous. What do you want from me? - Your life. - both grunt I saw myself. Sounds like you have an evil meta-twin. Where are you? grunts I'm right here. dramatic music I'm here to kill you, Flash, so get ready to fry. grunts Bring it on. Hmm. chuckles both grunting Told you. Zoom always wins. _ Zoom sent me here to kill you, but I didn't want to. But you were fine with killing Linda Park. It was the best bad idea I could come up with. Leave her body for Zoom to find, he'd think I was dead, and I'd be free. How was he supposed to know where to find her body? Just let me go. Let me disappear. You would spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, never knowing when Zoom is coming. Okay. And what's your great idea? How were you supposed to contact him after you killed me? I was supposed to get something something I could only get if you were dead and then throw it through the breach as proof. - And then what? - Then he'd come for me. Confirm the kill and bring me home. - Why do you want to know? - Because I want to find him. You really don't. He's gonna keep coming for me. He's gonna keep kidnapping people like you, forcing them to do what he wants. I have to stop him before more people die. - You can't stop Zoom. - Yes, I can. I will, but I need your help. Zoom wants Doctor Light to send him your new emblem. Yes. We need it for bait. If we can get Doctor Light to take my emblem, throw it through the breach, then Zoom will come to collect my body, and we can trap him. You know it took a lot of work to make that emblem, right? This is the woman who was willing to kill Linda in order to escape Zoom, but now she's willing to help us catch him? She knows it's the only way. Before I left Earth-2, I worked on a serum to dampen Zoom's speed. All we would need is for Ramon to develop a weapon to deliver it. Oh, great, that could be this year's cold gun. Maybe another criminal can get it, and then we'd have Sergeant Slow. I would never let that happen. Sergeant Slow is a terrible name. Are we forgetting how much more powerful than Barry Zoom seems to be? I mean, if Barry can catch bullets, what's to say Zoom can't catch whatever you shoot at him? Surprise the element of surprise. All we would do is rig a projectile to fire as Zoom crosses into the breach. He can't stop what he can't see coming. - That's great. - Thanks. Joe, voice of reason here? We need a plan. That's as good as any. As long as he can deliver. Don't underestimate me, Detective. phone vibrates Oh, Patty needs us back at the station. I'll meet you there, all right? Are you just forgetting everything Jay told us and supporting Wells now? Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all. I just want to see what he's up to. I figure we give him some rope, he'll hang himself. Yeah, I'm totally with you. I think he's hiding something. Look, my hunch after interrogating suspects all these years, something's not right with this dude. Barry told me about this thing you can do? - Vibing. - Oh, God, just relax. Can you do it with Wells? I can try. Incapable? Well, let me tell you something. If you are incapable of aligning the quantum helix and, by the way, the sole purpose of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs, could you save me some time and effort? Could you go out there and find someone who can actually do your job for you? There it is. Work voice. When I was little and you used to bring me to S.T.A.R. Labs with you, it used to freak me out how differently you talked here than when you were at home. You and your mother both. Shouldn't you be at school? I graduated high school when I was 15, Dad. - Right. - Can miss a day of college. Ah, that's my Jess, always so quick. - So? - So? Is it true? Is what true? What The Flash said about you at the press conference? That your particle accelerator created the meta-humans? - It is Jesse - Why didn't you just tell me? Jay Garrick, it turns out, is much faster at assigning blame than he is at actual heroics. - Dad, The Flash is a hero. - Uh-huh. Okay, I've never understood why you disliked him so much, but now I know it's because he knew what you'd done. What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs is change the world, Jesse, unlocking the mysteries of the universe. And when you don't have the key to the lock, sometimes you have to kick in the door. You should get to school. Don't worry. I got my education today. You're my joy, Jesse Quick. elevator bell dings - All right. Talk to you later. - See you, Joe. Great, you're here. Good morning to you too, Patty. Yes, I was up all night working on the Doctor Light case. I I've been trying to anticipate all the powers she might throw our way, you know, on the premise that she can manipulate light energy. - I appreciate it, but - Did you know that light energy can be turned into hard light? I mean, that doesn't even sound like a thing, but it is. Seriously, Patty No, and on the other end of the spectrum is invisibility. Look, it it's just hypothetical, but I think that The Doctor Light case is closed. Oh, uh, okay. Can you tell me why? No. No? - Okay. - Hey. - Hi! - Are you good? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Your dad just shut me down in a big way. - What do you mean? - I I don't know. It just You don't think it's because you and I kissed? Uh, no, I don't think he knows. I didn't say anything, but I can talk to him if you want. No, no, no, I'll talk to him. You know, he's my partner. We should have trust and communication. Are you sure? I don't mind talking about that kiss. It was a good kiss. Yeah, yeah, although the memory it's a little foggy. - Oh, really? - Yeah. I might need, like, a reminder soon. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Have you had any word from The Flash about the meta-human that killed Larkin? No, not yet, but I know he's working on it. You know, maybe I could talk to him. Linda, I don't think that's a good idea. Look, Larkin is dead, which makes it really hard for me to concentrate on field goals and doping scandals. I don't want to sit around being told not to worry my pretty little head about it. I get that. Believe me, I do. Then tell him I want to help. Please, I can't let this woman who looks like me hurt anyone else. I'll ask again. But trust me, Flash has everything under control. dramatic music Crap. breathing heavily Doctor Light's gone invisible. Lock the doors. Shut the doors! The doors aren't responding. None of the security protocols are responding. She's hacked the system. Barry, Doctor Light is escaping. Where is she? Doctor Light managed to hack into the lights of her cell. The whole building runs on fiber optics that operate on pulses of light, so she turned off the dampeners and used her powers. I told you how dangerous she was. You should have listened to me and sedated her. I thought I had convinced her that helping us was the only way she'd free herself from Zoom. - Well, you thought wrong. - Yeah. Okay, look, Doctor Light is gone, so instead of assigning blame, let's try to figure out what we're gonna do next. Do you think she's gonna try and take Linda again? I had Iris bring Linda to the house, just in case, to keep an eye on her. How are we doing with the speed-dampener? I think we isolated the composite. And we're modifying the dart The Arrow used to take down Wells. He's not Wells. I'm Wells. Whatever, Harry. But we don't even really know if this thing works. Until we try it, no. This will be a field test, so can we end this scintillating staff meeting and get back to work? Or how about I say what everybody's thinking? Maybe it's a good thing that Doctor Light is gone. Maybe it's the universe stopping us from doing something really stupid. No. No. Keep going. I'm gonna figure out another way to get Zoom. Hey, slow your roll. I want to talk to you. Joe, look, I know what I'm doing. Okay, I don't, so why don't you clue me in? I'm trying to stop Zoom. I thought you were on board with that. I'm keeping my options open. I don't understand why you think we have a choice. Zoom wants me dead. The meta-humans that he's sending from Earth-2, they don't care how many innocent people get in the way. Look at what happened to Iris and Linda's boss. He was just collateral damage in Zoom's war. The next time, that could be you or Iris. I'm just wondering if going after him now is premature. I mean, we barely know anything about his abilities. Wells does. You're putting a whole lot of faith in the man wearing the face of your mother's killer. I think we should find Jay, get him to help us on this. Yeah, Jay made it pretty clear that he doesn't want to help get me killed, and we can't just sit around and wait for Zoom to make his next move anymore. We can't. Aren't you the one who told me life isn't about playing defense, sometimes the only way to succeed is by working the offense? I think at the time we were talking about your high school football tryouts. You said you'd never bring that up again. Hey. I just wanted to say using the, uh, tungsten composite to dampen vibrations, that was, uh that was pretty brilliant. What are you doing? I'm congratulating you. Don't touch me. Wow, try to give a guy a compliment. You're not trying to give me a compliment. You're trying to meddle into things that are none of your business. - What did you vibe about me? - Nothing. - What did you vibe about me? - Nothing. God, why? What's there to vibe on? Don't touch me. If you have questions, ask them. Otherwise stay away from me. So? God, you'd think the serial killer version would've been the bigger jerk. What happened when you touched him? What did you see? Oh, I didn't see anything. Go touch him again. No, he's onto me now. Well, you have to keep trying. I mean, I think Joe's right. Something must have happened between Wells and Zoom, made this personal. sighs The Arrow of Starling City formerly known as The Hood, has been unmasked as billionaire Robert Queen. Robert was marooned on an island when his boat went down in the Pacific, an accident that ended with the tragic death of his son, Oliver. Robert Queen was thought dead when Excuse me, I'm receiving word. There has been an attack at Central City College. The science building was the focus of another meta-human attack. We are just receiving video. Please be advised, I'm being told that the footage you're about to see Hey, Jesse, it's Dad. Can you I just I saw on the news Just call me, all right? Let me know that you're okay. That you weren't Witnesses report that The Flash arrived on the scene but not before the hostile meta-human escaped with a hostage, a female student. We have not yet ID'd her, and there is no indication as to why she has been specifically targeted. exhales No. exhales Joe Detective can we talk for a minute? If this is about Doctor Light No, yeah No. Uh, maybe, but okay, look. I think I figured out why you've been a bit shut down the last couple of days. chuckles Really? Yeah, I feel like you're not being completely transparent with me, but I think that it's my fault. Look, you're a great excellent wonderful detective, and I think you can sense I'm not being completely transparent with you. And you're right. Look, we're partners. We need to be completely honest with each other. - No secrets - Patty. Barry and I kissed. There's something to being too transparent. No, no, no, no, I think that it's great that everything's just out there, right out in the open. Whatever you and Barry do in private is your own business. Okay. So you're not mad at me? I promise you, I could care less. sighs Great, I feel so much better. Is there anything, you know, maybe you've been meaning to tell me? We're partners totally transparent with each other. Uh nope. Cool. - Hey. - Hey. Are you guys having a dinner party? You would think. I know, I know. It's just, sometimes cooking helps me to relax. Oh. Have you heard anything about Doctor Light? Am I still in danger? - We're not really sure. - Come on. I'm going crazy here, Barry. Yeah, she is. timer dings That is the cake. Hope you're hungry. She's not kidding. There's enough food in there to feed an army. She must be terrified. Uh, more like furious. Larkin died trying to protect her, and it only makes it worse that the person who did it looks just like her. I mean, trust me. If Linda had Doctor Light's powers right now dramatic music What? I just, uh, Linda and Light They're identical. So identical that Light even thought she could fool Zoom. Now we have Light's suit. You don't even have to say anything, I know. - It's a terrible idea. - No, no, no, it's not. We make Zoom think that Linda is Doctor Light and use her to draw him out. It's too dangerous, right? Let Linda decide. I mean, she's desperate to catch the person who's responsible for Larkin's death, and she deserves the chance to help us. Okay. I still don't understand why we're here. I thought your dad said not to leave the house. - Someone wants to talk to you. - Who? Ms. Park, I need your help. Whoa. Heh, dude. How long you been sitting on this? It's important to have hobbies. laughter sighs This is ridiculous. No, it's not. You look just like Doctor Light. And with these gloves that Cisco rigged up, you'll be able to do what she does. Don't worry, they are totally safe. - Ish. - Ish? Well, come on, it's gotta be believable, so they really do fire and explode things. And you are going to have to let her hit you with those blasts when she gets the hang of it. Who exactly came up with this terrible idea? Okay, it's not a terrible idea. The suit can absorb the blasts. For real or ish? What does a terrible idea look like to you, Cisco? Okay, you know what? I like to think I can see the bright side of things, okay? Positivity, people. All right, all right. So just hit the ones of me. Okay? - Got it. - Great. Doctor Light. exhales deeply Oh! Oh! Oh! Uh, you know what? I'm just gonna adjust those a little. Screwdriver. Coming. Coming. chuckles Just Okay, so, um, do the opposite of that, and we'll have it. Rock and Roll Rave by The Preatures exhales breathing heavily  Well, you know that little place   You like to go after dark?  It's on fire. - screams - Ooh, sorry. - exhales - My bad.  Any wonder now, baby, what you're turning into   Is it something to fear when I'm looking at you?   But I find myself stepping deep down, deep down   To the rock and roll nightclub looking for  You  gasps Whoo-hoo-hoo! I did it! Did you see that? Yeah! Ooh! clatter You all good? You okay? Sorry. Okay, no offense to Linda, but there is no way she can pull this off. Well, maybe if she didn't scream every time she fired. Yup, Linda had a rocky start, but she can pull this off. I know she can. All right, did you find someplace near a breach where we don't have to worry about civilians getting in the way? Yeah, there's a place by the docks that's usually deserted at night. Awesome. How are we doing with the speed-dampener? - My tests indicate that it should work. - It will work. I'll tune up Ramon's gloves, make sure they work better. Okay, great. Hey, we're actually gonna go through with this? Yeah, we're doing this. I'm gonna have Iris get Linda ready. Yeah, I'll go talk to him. Barry, hold up. Hey, what? You saw what happened in there. Linda's not ready. She is. She's ready enough. Why are you pushing this? What why do you think? I want to get him. Get who, exactly? Is that a real question? You tell me. I'm I'm not sure this is even about Zoom. I'm starting to feel like you're still chasing the Reverse Flash. Reverse Flash is dead. Yeah, but after all he did to you, you weren't the one that stopped him. We all worked together. Yeah, and Eddie got him in the end. I mean, did that make you feel cheated, like you didn't get your revenge, and stopping Zoom is the next best thing? Look, all I'm saying is, if you're gonna ask people like Linda to risk their lives, you better be sure of exactly why they're doing it. dramatic music Look, I'm sorry I'm a terrible supervillain. I don't need you to come here and make me feel worse. That's not why I'm here. Doesn't matter, I I can't do this. I just don't have it in me. That's not true. You're one of the strongest women I've ever met. You can do anything. And you know that about me based on what exactly? sighs Linda, you are trusting me. So I need to trust you fully. I know that you can do this Because I know you. whispers Barry. Holy crap. I've made out with The Flash. Listen, I just want to bury the hatchet and say thank you for all your work. You're welcome. Okay. sighs I think maybe the trigger mechanisms are just sticking. It's not the trigger mechanisms. - I think - It's not the don't, no It's just a little bit of oil. sighs Ugh, I'm just gonna clean this up really quick. - Do not touch me. - I'm just trying to help. sobbing I know Wells went to the other Earth. Why? I don't know, I swear. Your loyalty is admirable, Jesse. screaming I'm sorry. Joe, Doctor Light. - I thought we settled that. - No, we didn't. She's still out there on the loose a meta-human who just murdered a man. Why aren't we doing something about it? Look, none of this makes any sense, and you're not talking to me. All right, all right, all right, look. It's a bit complicated, but we're not going after Doctor Light right now. I need you to trust me, Patty, for a few days or so. Are you somehow involved in this? If you're asking if I'm dirty, no, but I need some time to take care of some things. I trust you, I do. I wouldn't be your partner if I didn't. This is about you not trusting me. - Patty, I trust you. - Not enough. A few days. - Hey. - Hey. Do you want to maybe grab dinner tonight? I could use your opinion about something. I can't tonight. I'm sorry. - phone vibrates - Sure. I I would. Joe and I actually Joe and I have a thing that we've gotta do tonight. Some other time. I would much rather be spending the evening with you. Seriously, if I could cancel these plans, I would. Can we do dinner tomorrow? Yeah, I would like that. All right, I'll see you. Good luck with your thing. Thanks. I think I'll need it. I'm here to kill The Flash, and no one can stop me! How's that? Uh, it's a little too much. Uh, stop messing with the earpiece. Yeah, you don't want to dislodge it. Right, you you told me that. I'm sorry. No, no, you're doing great, Linda. All right, Doctor Light, here I am. But we're gonna skip the part where you say you're gonna kill me and go right to the part where I don't let you. I'm here to kill you, Flash. whispering Wait, what are you doing? We're skipping that? whispering Yes. Uh, I am loyal to Zoom, so get ready to fry. Next time we're doing this, I'm writing better dialogue. - Next time? - Next time? dramatic music Uh groans - Oh! - Gotcha. - Yeah, you did. - Real good. All right. Ugh. Bring it on. Hmm. both grunting Told you, Zoom always wins. - whispers You're okay, right? - Yeah, yeah. I had to make it look good. Here it is, Zoom, I did what you wanted. Now bring me home. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is everything he wants, right? Come on, Zoom. Hey, stop fidgeting. Sorry, it's been an hour. I landed in a ridiculous position, and my foot fell asleep. He's probably just waiting to see if you're really dead. Any minute now, he's gonna strike. No. Sorry, I probably screwed up somehow. No, Linda, you did great. Ugh. So Wells ain't taking this well. - Mm-hmm. - How about you? Yeah, it just sucks, you know. You were right a little bit about this not being just about Zoom about it being about the Reverse Flash. Okay. But not for the reason that you think, not because I didn't beat him. It's Wells he said something to me on that video before he confessed to my mom's murder. He said that even if he was dead, that he still won because I wasn't happy, that I'd never really be happy. How the hell would he know? He knew me. He knows future me. That's future you. This is the you here and now. I still think that Wells is right. Ever since I went back to that night and I didn't save her I didn't save my mom, I just there's just been this void in me. You know, I just feel like that is always gonna be there. For better or worse, Wells He knew me. Better than I know you? He may have stalked you for 15 years, but I raised you. Look, Wells said what he said to you to mess with you to get in your head one last time. If you listen to him, you let him win. I know. I don't want that. You're responsible for your own happiness, Barry. Forget about Wells. Think hard about what you want and what makes you happy. Go out and get it. Simple as that. - All right? - Yeah. laughs And look at their eyes. Amazing. Oh, good to see you guys. - Bye. - Bye, Patty. laughs - Hey! - Hey. Have you seen this video of babies' expressions as they go through tunnels? Their faces are priceless. I'm not baby crazy or soft music Wow. What did I do to deserve that? I've just been thinking about what makes me happy, and getting to know you makes me happy. We should do more of that then. - laughs softly - Hey. I wish I could have kept the gloves at least. What would you have done with them? Raves, duh. laughter That is not what you were thinking about. I was thinking about a lot of things. Like how everything that's happened to me the past few days is the best story I can never write. Ooh, tell me about it. Do you ever get used to it? Keeping a secret that big? No. It's pretty heavy. I need a good night's sleep. chuckles I'm gonna head out. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, hey, if we're gonna be The Flash's sidekicks, we should probably join CrossFit or something, you know? - Oh, yeah, girl. - Yeah. Bye. gasps growls ominous music Linda! There you go. It's like you think these things just grow on trees or something. And we threw away the last one for nothing. You've been going over this footage dozens of times. Everything went exactly according to plan. If it had, Zoom would have shown up. Maybe Light was wrong. Maybe he can't see through the breaches. Or maybe he finally decided to give up. phone vibrates Hey. Iris, slow down. I can't understand you. watch beeping alarm beeping Zoom has Linda. He's on the roof. ominous music - chuckles - Put her down. You like to fish with bait? I do too. gasps whimpering screaming Come on. Come on. grunts You need to get out of here, okay? No, you can't fight that thing. It's a monster. Just go. Zoom cannot be human. He is Or was. How the hell is Barry supposed to defeat that? Why is he running away? He's not. He's not scared. Ooh, he's gonna thunderbolt him! What? Jay taught him how to throw lightning. groaning Did you guys see that? See him catch a bolt of lightning with his demonic claws? Yeah, saw that. Jay was right. He cannot do this alone. He's not alone. - Run, Barry. - No. I'm gonna see if Wells' speed-dampening serum works. What do you want from me? Everything. You want to be me? Is that it? You want to be a hero? chuckles Heroes die. Only if you can catch them. dramatic music How is Barry gonna match Zoom's speed? Genius. He's not gonna match it. He's gonna take it out of the equation altogether. - What are you talking about? - Terminal velocity. The highest velocity attainable by a falling object. - Falling through the air? - Yeah, freefall fight. Their drag force equals the downward force of gravity, making the net force zero, making Equal velocities. That is genius. groans Never forget, I am the fastest man alive. - groans - electronic beeping - He's killing him. - Barry. You're next. whispers Barry. Look at your hero. camera shutter clicks This man is no god. He is nothing! gasps The days of The Flash protecting this city are over. - No, hold your fire. - Put him down. Now what will you do without your precious hero? Shoot that thing, now. gunfire Nice try. dramatic music - Anything? - No. - Do you have him? - No. Barry! Harrison Wells, you thought you could defeat me with this? I made a mistake. Yes, a costly one. gasping Goodbye, Flash. You, too, weren't fast enough. - dart fires - growls Ah! No. No! Stay with me. Stay with me, Barry. Stay with me. Please, Barry, please. This is all you! If Barry dies, you die. Joe, Barry's vitals have stabilized. - Let's let him go. - No, Caitlin. Why? What good does that do for Barry? It's gonna help me. Joe, stop. Who's Jesse? How do Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her. You've you did vibe me. - Yes. - What did you see? I saw your daughter. She was with Zoom. But she's alive? Yeah. sighs Zoom sent you here like the others? You kill The Flash, and you get your daughter back? The only way I get my daughter back is, I capture Zoom. Do you understand? You love Barry. I love my daughter. And none of these children are safe as long as Zoom is here. I tried on my Earth to capture him. I failed. I thought I could bring him down here with Barry's help. I was wrong. dramatic music Hey, I think he's waking up. Barry. Barry? Can you hear me? Hey. chuckles You scared the crap out of us. You were gone for a long time. How bad is it? Bad. If you didn't heal so quickly, I'd be very worried. - Linda how is she? - She's fine. She's staying with some friends out in Coast City. Zoom? Let's Let's worry about Zoom when you're up and about, okay? Oh, no, you're staying put. Yeah, seriously, you got your ass kicked. No, guys, I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on "The Flash" Zoom wants me dead. The meta-humans that he's sending from Earth-2, they don't care how many innocent people get in the way. I have to go. I need you to tell me that it's okay. - Ah! - Barry. Is this the face of your hero, Central City? - Ah! - Ah! Seriously got your ass kicked. I can't feel my legs. All right, I got you. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. I can't do it right now, all right? - Oh, yes you can, Barry. - No, no, no. We've been making so much progress. Yep, six whole steps. Someone get me a Bozo button. Hey, give yourself some credit. You just broke your back. Yeah, a normal person would've been paralyzed the rest of his life. How long until I'm fully healed? The initial MRI I took a week ago showed a complete dislocation at the T12-L1 interspace of the thoracolumbar junction. But this is the MRI I took this morning. It's remarkable, but you're almost completely healed. I'm still having trouble breathing. That's totally normal with a spinal injury. It should clear up soon. We're going to get you back in that suit, Barry. Real quick, trust me. What are we gonna do about Zoom? No sign of him since Cisco nailed him with that tranq dart. And I haven't vibed since then. - Maybe Zoom's not coming back. - I highly doubt that. Which is why I'm gonna go do something about it. What do you mean, go do something about it? I need access to your breach room and your speed cannon. Why is that? Because, Barry, it's time to go home. So, you show up on our Earth, you screw everything up, and now you want to go home? Sounds very familiar. Again, that wasn't me. I need to go take care of Zoom once and for all before anyone else gets killed. How do you plan on doing that? I'll think of something. Ramon, if you'll escort me to the speed cannon. No, no, you can't go through the breach. Yeah, he can. Jay taught us how to send people. That's not what I mean. Look, if you can figure out how to stop Zoom on your Earth, you can figure out how to do it here. We need you to stay here until we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells. What I need, Dr. Snow, is to return home. And I'm going to that with or without your assistance. What are you doing? If Harry wants to gobye. Look, like it or not, Cisco, we need his help. I'm not sure another plan from Wells is what we need. Yeah, I mean, the last bright idea he had nearly got Barry killed. I know, but Jay's gone, and Dr. Wells knows Zoom better than anyone, so until Barry is back on his feet again, we need to keep Wells around in case Zoom returns. Caitlin, if he doesn't want to be here, then we're better off without him. Let him go. I can't do that. Not yet. Oh, snap, meta-human attack. Nope, nope, my bad, that is just an alert for me. - For what? - Oh, it's just a reminder. I have a date in an hour, so Oh, with who? With the lovely Kendra Saunders, the barista at Jitters. Oh, she makes a mean latte. I think we're gonna go out for dinner and a movie, and then, I don't know, maybe some breakfast. Wait, breakfast? Why breakfast? I don't Yeah 'Cause, you know, you go home - Cisco. - And - He's messing with you. - Go. Oh. Patty. - Patty, hey. - Hey. I hear you're still sick. Yeah, yeah, it's a Nasty bug. Well, I make a mean chicken noodle soup from scratch. I could bring some by later if you'd like. No, that's sweet, I just I'd feel terrible if you caught any of this. Besides, I love the canned stuff. Okay, well, try to stay off your feet. Oh, yeah, believe me, I am. You sure you're okay? You sound like something's up. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm just not myself right now. Okay, well, I hope to see you soon, and, uh, feel better. - Thanks. - Bye. Bye. You should stay away from the cheese curds. They're addicting. I'm going to take a wild stab and guess that you're here without the consent of the rest of your fabulous team. It's been difficult, having you here. For all of us. You don't have to worry about that anymore because I'm leaving. We can help you save your daughter. I know that's why you want to go home. Look, I made a big mistake coming here. My plan was to get The Flash's help and use that help to stop Zoom, and my plan failed. I don't have another plan, except to go back home and face Zoom myself. So let's say you go back to your Earth, and you fight Zoom. He will kill you. And then, how does that help your daughter? Look, the best way to save Jesse is for you to stay here, and work with us as a team. No. Now, please leave me alone, while I discover which one of these breaches is gonna get me home. You know, you're lucky Cisco and Professor Stein never figured out how to close all the breaches, 'cause then you'd be stuck here. Wait. We close the breaches. All of them, except one, so Zoom only has one way to get to this world. - The breach at S.T.A.R. Labs. - Exactly. And then we set a trap. It's got fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles, and, it's ranked as one of the best date movies of all time. Well, let's see if that's true. Cisco? Are you okay? I gotta go. What? Why? I am so sorry that this is happening right now. I am so, so sorry. Um, I have to go. I'll call you, okay? I'll call you, I swear. Mm! Okay, Brian, let that sit overnight, and then we'll assay in the morning. Dr. Shore? You okay? What are you doing? You can't take that out of here. Ah! What happened to me? What are you? Ah! Foolish Human I am Grodd. Patty. What'd you find? Found these weird-looking hairs all over the street. I'm gonna run 'em against the database and see what I can find. Uh, here, our victim. His name's Dr. Jeffrey Shore. He's a biochemistry engineer here at Vaughan Pharmaceuticals. This is the second dead lab tech in two weeks. That ain't a coincidence. Yeah, and like the other tech, he had just stolen a serum from their storage cooler. - Really? What kind of serum? - It's called Cortexin. It's used to treat encephalopathy, a blood disease in the brain. The serum's missing, but his colleagues found him here a couple of minutes later, dead. He didn't get far. He died from blunt force trauma to the head. Ugh, and apparently a lot of it. Yeah, check this out. - Is that his blood? - Point of impact. Okay. Can you run through what you told me to her and see if you can get anything else, and if the cases are linked? Sure thing. - Hi. - Some of the evidence. I'll be right with you. Uh, Detective? How's Barry feeling? Oh, heading to see him right now. He asked me to bring him some of my homemade chicken noodle soup. He hates that canned stuff. Don't we all. Faster, Barry! There you go. Push yourself! Barry! Are you okay? Oh, yeah, you know, I'm not great right now. What happened? It's nothing. I'm good, all right? - Just forget it. - Barry. Talk to us. We can help you. No, you can't help me. Not this time. I'm sorry. You just you wouldn't understand. What up, Barry? Zoom destroyed me. He showed everyone in Central City what he could do, and that I'm powerless to stop him. They gave me a key to this city, Joe. I'm supposed to be their hero. I'm supposed to be the guy that can protect them from something as evil as that, and I failed in front of all of them. When they think of the Flash, all they see now is someone not strong enough to protect them. - Hey. - I'm good. Oh, hey, I know I keep asking, but have you read any reports or anything recently about a Birdman attacking anywhere? There's no such thing as a Birdman, Cisco. Okay, like that's a stretch. In this city? Look, I know what I vibed. It was a man with these big, wide wings. It was crazy. What if it was an angel? It was an angel. Caitlin? Okay, come on, like that's a crazy idea. Ah! What is wrong with you? Just don't know what to do about Barry. I mean, all the test results say he's fine, but it's like there's something holding him back. I keep trying to talk to him, but I can't get through. Then maybe we should get the person who can. We can talk about that when I see you at home. I gotta take this, okay? Okay. - Bye, baby. - Bye. Patty, what's up? Turns out our dead scientist cases are linked. Okay, hit me. Well, the other scientist stole a large quantity of a racetam drug, typically used to treat patients with Vertigo. Okay, so we got two stolen drugs, one for blood disorders of the brain, and the other one for Vertigo. What's the connection? Well, they are both nootropic drugs, used to enhance intelligence. Hey, did you get results from the hairs you found? Yes, I did. Uh, apparently they were all over the other crime scene too. The weird thing is, they're not human hairs. - Uh, they're hairs from a - From a gorilla. - How How did you know? - Patty, I gotta go. But Uh Did Caitlin come through here? No. She just hit me in the face and ran away. Yo! - Grodd! - What? - Grodd's back. - Caitlin. That must be why she was acting like that. She was being mind-controlled. I'm continually amazed by the similarity between our two worlds. You got talking gorillas on your Earth, too? - Oh, yeah. - Remind me never to go there. Ramon, why would this Grodd abduct Dr. Snow? I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. She was always so nice to him. He mind-controlled two lab technicians to steal chemicals that enhance intelligence. He wants her for something. Well, looks like he left his bachelor pad in the sewers. Grodd's a big-ass gorilla. He can't just waltz through downtown in the middle of the day without anybody noticing. Right, and if there's been sightings, then we might be able to approximate his location. I can call CCPD. They can access the tip hotline, send over files of Grodd's recent attacks. Good. We gotta get her back. We will. Barry. - Barry! - Yeah? You can't blame yourself for this. There's nothing you could've done. I still don't have my speed. How are we supposed to save her from Grodd? You may not have your legs just yet, but you still got that brain. Use it. Help us figure that out. Where are you? Caitlin. Grodd? You Remember me? Caitlin always kind Why did you bring me here? Need help. I I don't understand. How did I become Grodd? Oh. That's a long story, Grodd. Um The dark matter from the particle accelerator explosion? That's how this happened. Repeat. Repeat? Need to repeat Grodd. You want me to make more like you? I don't know how to do that. Learn. Keep that chin down, slugger. Dad. Yeah. That was a hell of an idea you had, bringing Henry here. Well, he may not have his mother, but he's got two amazing fathers. Seemed like he needed both. Hmm. - Good girl. - Mm. So how did Grodd become sentient? A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs had this contract with the military to research and awaken latent mind-reading capabilities for interrogation purposes. And I'm guessing Grodd is one of the test subjects? Right, but then Dr. Wells shut down the program, and we all thought it was to save Grodd from all the crazy mind-control experiments, but it was really so that Dr. Wells could use the accelerator explosion to create a 1,500-pound mind-controlling gorilla that he could manipulate. What kind of algorithm is that? It's an algorithm meant to extrapolate Grodd's location from places we know he's already been. Hello. There we have it. No spinal cord edema. I don't see any subacute hemorrhaging. Bone fused beautifully. You're all good, Barry. I'd give you some physical therapy, but you don't need it. I'm really glad you're here, Dad. Me too. You know, I tried to call, but you can't get a cell in Granite Peak National Park, so Granite Peak what are you You went camping by yourself? Yeah, yeah, I got a tent. I went fishing every day. I have had my fill of largemouth bass for a while. Sometimes you just have to slow down to get back to where you want to be. - Yeah. Look, Dad - Hey, guys. I think we've found them. Yeah? Grodd has to be in one of these three bell towers. The only reason we couldn't find him on any cameras underneath the city before is 'cause he upgraded from a bachelor pad to a penthouse, like a baller. Okay, so we know where he is. We still don't know how to get her. - We got a plan for you. - What's the plan? We use me. That's Harry! That's the other Wells! - Barry. - Let him go. Let him go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We found another suit in the Time Vault. - I thought he was dead. - He's dead. This is this is Harrison Wells from Earth-2. - Earth-2? - I'll explain later. If we can get Harry to convince Grodd that he's Wells, that he's his father, maybe we can convince him to let Caitlin go. I'm not gonna be able to help if anything goes wrong. That's a chance I'm willing to take. Looks like we're 0 for 2 on the bell towers, huh? I like to think of it more as, now we know exactly where they are. Okay, let's do this again. Gimme your best Wells. I'm not doing the Wells again, Ramon. - I told you - Look. I just made these anti-mind-control ear buds. They could fail, and if they do, you're toast, so you're gonna need to nail it if you want to live. Ramon. - Cisco. - Cisco. In many ways, you've shown me what it's like to have a son. What? Okay, let's Let's just try it again. This time, up the creep factor, like, a lot more, and make it a little more sincere. Like you really love me, but you're gonna have to kill me anyway. Cisco. In many ways, you've shown me what it's like to have a son. Yup, that's the one. Here you go. Yo. Yeah, we're moving on to the third location. Copy that. Now we wait. So this is what it's like every time you go after one of those meta-humans? Uh, pretty much. Only, Cisco and Caitlin are normally the ones in here and I'm the one out there. Well, there's no reason you shouldn't be. Iris showed me what happened. With Zoom? That was hard to watch. I can only imagine what that must have been like for you. He showed everyone in Central City that their hero wasn't good enough to stop him. Well, that's certainly what it looked like. Was he right? Your body's healed, Barry, and yet here you are, feeling the shame of losing. I can't stop him. I know it. He knows it. And now everyone in this city knows it too. They don't believe in me anymore, Dad. At my trial for your mother's death, a lot of our family and friends were in the courtroom. They heard awful things about what I had done to your mother. It didn't matter that it wasn't true. Every day, I could see it on their faces, the moment when I lost them, until everybody had stopped believing in me. Well, that was my reality. You know, I was gonna serve a life sentence for a crime I didn't commit, but worse than that, every time I looked at someone in the eye from that moment forward, they were gonna believe that I had killed the woman I loved in front of our son. So yeah, I do know what it's like being destroyed. How did you get past that? I embraced it. Accepting it was the only way that I could move forward, but I knew that if I could survive that, and learn to believe in myself again, then I could survive anything. You know what lit that belief in me, Barry? You. believing in me, gave me that hope. And now I'm giving it back to you, son. No more monsters can take that from us. So, one of the main differences between ape and human brains is the white matter and connectivity in the brain cells. The chemicals that you were treated with as an infant were meant to overcome those differences and cause an explosive growth of both, similar to what humans experience in their first few years of life. Maybe these chemicals can be used to duplicate that growth, and then we won't need a particle accelerator explosion. Hey, buddy. Easy, buddy. It's me. I'm back. Father, you died. No. No, buddy, I didn't die. I just went away for a while. All right, that's great, Wells, keep talking. But now that I'm back, we don't need Caitlin anymore, do we, buddy? So you can let her go. Come on, buddy. Let me get her out of here. Please. Father never ask. Father take. Run. Who are you? Cisco, you gotta get in there, man. Oh, Cisco, thank God. Okay, you guys gotta get out of there. Harry's trapped. We can't leave him here. What do we do? The drugs. The drugs that Grodd stole. Wells an overdose of those drugs will shock his brain. Okay, just hit him with as much as you can. You are not him! You are not Father! I am father. And you hit father. Grodd. Look at me. Look at me! I would never leave you here alone. Grodd, I made you a promise. I have bigger plans for you. Remember? One day, this city will be yours. I promised you. I intend to honor that promise. Go! Come on. - Thank you. - Thank you for rescuing me. Well, we're a team, right? I'm impressed. I think we all are. Yeah, well, we need to do something about Grodd. - Like what? - Like get rid of him for good. You want to kill him? Considering how many people he's killed, yeah. This isn't Grodd's fault. He's only like this because Wells made him this way. Yes, but, Catie, he kidnapped you and you could have died. You didn't see what I saw. Grodd's getting smarter. He's lonely and sad. He wants more apes like him. What are you saying? He wants kids? 'Cause I'm pretty sure one telepathic Grape Ape is more than enough for this city. I know somewhere we could send him. What are you talking about? When the singularity exploded and I discovered the breach in S.T.A.R. Labs, I ran similar tests and discovered the same thing, The difference being the breaches in Central City are scattered all throughout the city whereas counterparts in my world most definitely are not. And you know where they lead? Well, I was in the process of figuring all that out when Dr. Snow so gallantly convinced me to stay, but if I am correct, this breach is gonna get Grodd as close to home as he's ever likely to get. Okay, even if you're right, how do we bait Grodd to go through it? My son'll do it. Won't you, Flash? Grodd? Caitlin. Flash. You want Caitlin, Grodd, you're gonna have to catch me first. So Barry's gonna lure Grodd in front of the breach? Yep, and once he gets him to the right spot, Cisco's gonna blast him into Earth-2 with his thingamajig. - Speed cannon. - Exactly. Well, things have gotten a lot more complicated since I got out of prison. - Mm-hmm. - Man, you have no idea. Cisco, almost there. Are you ready? I'm in position. Now, once you turn on the speed cannon, the quark matter will stabilize, stretching the breach about so big, so anywhere within this circle will suffice. Right on time. Okay, come on. I don't have eyes on Grodd. Does anyone see him? That is a big gorilla. Where is Caitlin? Ah! - Oh, my God. - Get up, Barry. Ah! Where is Caitlin, Flash? Right here. No. No, no, no. You need to let him go, Grodd. Flash is my enemy. Now you, too. No. He was trying to save me from you. We didn't understand what you wanted, but now we do. I can give you what you want. I can give you a home. You just have to trust me. All right, here he comes. Ready to flip the switch. Now, Barry. - Full power. - It is. Barry, you can't let Grodd get free. Conquer your fears, son. Believe in yourself. Come on, come on, come on. Welcome back, Flash. Thanks, bro. I can't believe something good finally came from that suit. First and the last time. That thing still gives me the creeps. We should destroy it. Let's do that, but see if you can figure out how to get it back in this ring first. Might be nice to have something like that instead of carrying around a bag all the time. I can help you with that. What? I know a thing or two about micro-technology. Yeah, you know a thing or two about a lot of things. Well, as long as what he knows keeps my son and these good people safe, the more you know, the better. Pleasure to meet you, Harrison. Again. Dr. Allen. Good to see you. Cisco. - Let's go. - Take care. So, Dr. Wells, this place on your Earth that we've sent Grodd, what is it exactly? It's a refuge where gorillas subjected to lab experiments, like Grodd, can roam freely. I know it's for the best, but I still feel like I betrayed him. No, don't say that. You didn't betray him. You gave him a better life. I still don't understand, though, I Why do the breaches on our Earth lead to different places on yours? I don't know yet, Ramon, but I do know we have to close them all, and I don't know how to do that. You don't have to do it alone anymore. Any of it. Together, we defeated Grodd, and if we stay that way, we will figure out how to close the breaches, get Zoom, and get you your daughter back. Thank you. Oh, this one is definitely a keeper. Oh, yeah. He could've done your standard vinegar and baking soda volcano, but no, Barry wanted to do a molecular structure of chocolate and nougat. - Mm-hmm. - That's my favorite candy bar. Who does that in the sixth grade? Why, a true science nerd. Like father, like son, I suppose. All right, Dad, we should get going. Yeah. Uh, Joe, can I have - Yeah. - Thanks. Iris, thank you so much for reaching out to me. I am so glad you did. Me, too. Joe, there are no words, man. Thanks. All right, I'm gonna swing by my lab before I come home. Which reminds me Patty? She's a smart girl. She's not buying your whole sick story, FYI. - All right. - Patty? Would this be a new girlfriend? Uh, yeah, something like that, yeah. We'll talk about it on the way to the bus station. Come on. - Bye. - See ya. You okay? It's embarrassing. I I love Barry like he's my own son, but when I'm reminded that he isn't, I start to wonder what it would've been like if, you know Dad, you would've been just as amazing with your own son, just like you were with me and Barry. I hear you've been spending a lot of time up here. Well, you know what they say. When the CSI's away It's good to see you on your feet again. Must've been all that canned soup you had. Or maybe the homemade stuff Joe brought you? It yeah, I wasn't actually sick, Patty. Yeah, I figured that out. Why did you lie to me? My dad was in town. I needed to spend some time with him. And you couldn't just tell me that? You gotta understand, Patty, my dad was convicted of murder. When someone's image has been tarnished like that, it's hard for some people to see past it. And you seriously think I'm one of those people? No, I know, I should've given you more credit. No, you should've given yourself more credit. This isn't about your father, Barry. This is about you. I need to know that I can trust you if we're gonna do this. - Okay. - I'm serious. I can tell. You cannot always be a smart ass. - Hi. - Hi. I didn't know if you liked flowers or chocolate, so I got you both. Well, I'm allergic to chocolate, and I think that flowers are a waste of money. Um I have lollipops in my car? - Cisco, I'm joking. - Oh, God. This is great. Thank you. Listen, I wanted to come over here and say I'm sorry for bailing the other night. I I'm a liaison with the CCPD and there was an emergency, and I had to be there. - The CCPD? - Yeah. Wow, that's really cool. And very brave. Thank you. And this is very, very sweet, Cisco. Um, what is this? - Well, see, that right there. - Mm-hmm? That's a digital movie projector. I loaded all of "Princess Bride" on there. Mm-hmm, that's right. So, all we need is a wall, or, you know, some place where we can pick up our date where we left off. Well, if we're gonna pick up right where we left it Whoa. Whoa what? What's wrong? Nothing. You're just a really amazing kisser. Okay. - Let's go watch "Princess Bride."
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats. And I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on "The Flash" and "Arrow" The person who broke into my facility last night was Harrison Wells. Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2. I came here to help you, Barry. He may not be Harrison Wells from your Earth. He has just as many secrets as the one you knew. I get these feelings sometimes, these vibes. I'm not sure what triggers it. Sometimes it just happens. tires screeching You can always talk to me. - Partners? - Partners. This is a million dollars. That money is yours once you tell Oliver that you've lost the baby. I've been running a lot lately, trying to go faster than I've ever gone before. Because there's someone out there who's better, faster, and stronger than I am, and I need to be ready. But no matter how much I try or how hard I push myself, I keep running into the same problem. He just hit 1,375. What's the fastest Barry's run? Little over Mach two, when he ran back in time. That's not good. That's good, Barry. We have our work cut out for us. - I'm not getting faster, am I? - Well No, you're not. All right, well, let's fix this, right? I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed. It felt like I was standing still next to him. That's because you practically were. Zoom is at least three, four times faster than you at this point. How is he so much faster than Barry is and Jay was? Physiology, form, strength, could be a number of things Attitude, diet. Okay, all right, well, there's got to be something we can do about it, so let's just figure it out - fast, okay? - cell phone vibrating All right, I got to go. I'm meeting Patty. I'll see you. Thank you. So how are we going to help Barry? I'm out of ideas, and we've tried everything you've suggested. Well, not everything. metal rattling dramatic music   Welcome home. - Any trouble? - Nah. But believe it or not, we got ourselves a stowaway. - He give you his name? - Didn't say. Sat in the brig silent for three weeks. He was all decked out in this when we found him. - Jeez, how many are there? - 32. And I'll polish them all in blood before long. I've waited a long time for this hunt, and you have brought me very close to my prey. Mister, you're not going to do any hunting in those handcuffs. Oh, but, Captain, you're wearing the cuffs. Who taught you that Houdini? Actually, I taught him. gunshots Soon another sacrifice will be made. I feel you out there. Man, this was a bloodbath. Done by one person. One person did all this? Oh, yeah, you can see from the blood pattern. This guy was shot first, then the police chief, then these three were stabbed before finishing off the captain. Wow. Do you think a meta-human did it? I don't know, but I found this in all of the stab victims' wounds. It's some type of cryptocrystalline Flint, most likely Probably broke off the blade during the fight. I'll run it to make sure. Let's see what stores sell those kind of flint knives. Will do. And, uh, I'll call you later. - Okay. - Okay. So cute. You guys are trying not to be affectionate in front of me. Oh, no, we're just showing some professionalism. Yeah. chuckles  I know that you're unstoppable, babe    Advantages of a trusting manager. laughs Oh, a lot's gone down in this place. Nice. So what's up? I thought we were gonna go to dinner. Whoa. What's going on here? I couldn't decide which restaurant to go to, so I thought we would create our own. VoilÃ . Short rib, Yukon gold puree, and asparagus. Got to have a vegetable. This is nice. I like to cook. I didn't know if you like red or white, so I got you both. Ooh, two bottles. That's kind of dangerous, don't you think? You're not gonna run away all of a sudden, are you? Trust me, I'm staying by your side as long as possible. Good. You know, it's been really great hanging out these last few weeks. And it's helped make the move a lot easier, so thanks. You're very welcome. speaking Egyptian Arabic Sorry. How did you get in here? Hey, man, this place is closed. You are just as beautiful in this life as any other, Priestess Chay-Ara. Priestess? Uh, you're going to have to go, dude. Oh, not without her dude. Oh, my God. Cisco. I don't understand. What do you want? I believe I was clear. - cell phone dialing rapidly - _ cell phone ringing, vibrating _ Kendra's not going anywhere with you, Highlander. Oh, is that your name now? Kendra Quite boring. I believe it allowed you to blend in for a while. Now, give her to me, and I'll make your death fast. It ain't gonna happen. You are done here, pal. So is he! Oh! Thank God, Barry. Dude, come on. I can't believe you're The Flash. And that you work with The Flash. chuckles Yeah, let's keep that on the DL. This is the same knife that was used to kill the men at the docks. Residue is a perfect match. - So it is the same guy. - Definitely. But the thing is, these blades are old, centuries old. Do you have any idea why this guy would be after you? No, I've never seen him before in my life. Well, he was certainly acting like he knew you. He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara. That's Coptic. - You mean Egyptian? - That's right. Well, I grew up in Wisconsin, and I've never even left the States, so This guy, he's clearly incredibly dangerous, so I need you to at least let us try to protect you. I can put a detail on her. You didn't see this guy, Joe. No offense, but I don't think a cop is going to be able to protect her. No, but we do have a few friends who could lend a hand. But we're going to need to leave Central City. And go where? You really want to go to Star City? Come on, we don't need Team Arrow's help. Yeah, I think we do, man. Man, you've fought meta-humans with abilities a lot worse than knife-throwing. I don't think this guy's a meta-human. There's something different about him, something, ah, mystical. Mystical, really? We stop meta-humans because we're scientists. We can figure out what their weaknesses are, but we don't have any experience when it comes to guys like this, with magic. They do. Mm, this wouldn't have anything to do with Zoom, would it? No. I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe. This is the best way to do that. Right. Okay, I'm with you. But how do we even know Oliver and them even have time to help us? How busy can they be? gasping gasping mockingly Oh, gosh, that's fun. I really could do this all day. Open it up. They could've at least tried to hide this chemical bomb. Serves them right, it getting stolen and used against them. Oh, you brought arrows to a gunfight. What guns? Oh, that was actually pretty clever. Kill them. "Felicity, the magnetic-arrow gag will never work." chuckles Yes, it will, my love, because I am really smart. And guess what, Oliver. It did work. Felicity, honey, it's a little hard to fight with you doing that in my ear. Oh, I totally forgot that this was an open line. Keep doing what you're doing. Make smart decisions. suspenseful music Ooh! You know, I got to be honest. I really thought we'd be doing this dance a lot longer. Night-night. laughs What was that? vomits Damn it. Every time. It's The Flash. Did I know we knew The Flash? We know The Flash. Okay. - I didn't know we knew The Flash. - Thank you. But I don't think you ran all the way here to protect us. No, not to protect you. I need to protect a friend. Wow. Nice new digs. Also, I just noticed, no sleeves. Don't you get cold? I spent the better part of five years on an island in the North China Sea. I don't get cold, Barry. Barry, it's so good to see you. Felicity. Good to see you, Felicity. How come you didn't tell me Zoom broke your back? - I - Oh, I'm so glad you're okay. So this is what it's like dating her? More bruises from her than from Deathstroke. Okay, S.T.A.R. Labs is impressive, but this is This is completely wrong! Did you guys even look at the specs I sent over? This is a tragedy. I'm mourning for the death of engineering. Copper wiring to handle the processing speed from the Palmer Satellite, or else your system is gonna overload. Yeah, but that hasn't happened. I mean, it hasn't happened since last week. I mean, it didn't It happened yesterday. - Hi. - I'm Felicity. I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's She's, uh, my, uh, new, beautiful friend who kisses me occasionally. Right. Um, I'm Thea. This is John Diggle and my brother. Oliver Queen. - Yeah, I know. - Hi. Wow. Okay, first to meet The Flash and now the Green Arrow. Do you have any other surprises for me? chuckles Please, no more surprises. Barry said that you need our help. Somebody very dangerous is after you. Yeah, and I have no idea why. What does this guy even look like? Hold on. Okay, this is him. Yeah, see, that's something I would never think of. Hey, kind of rocking that Dothraki look hot. Let's see if facial recognition can find a match. keys clacking, computer beeping - That's him. - Yeah, strange. This picture's from 1975. Which would make him about Okay, what else can you tell us? He said we've known each other for ages, but I've never met the man before. There has to be some kind of connection. Not one I can think of. I just moved to Central City six months ago. Why'd you move there? I just felt drawn to the city, I guess. Kendra, there is a reason this guy's after you. Think. Look, man, we just came out here to hide out for a bit until we figure things out, so you can just take it down You came here because you need our help. This is what my help looks like. Oliver, I just saved you guys from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls was about to do. The least you can do is Barry, none of us have superpowers. You brought Kendra into our world without knowing who she is or what this dude that is after her is looking for. You made all of us unsafe. So maybe you ask the questions. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - We're all friends here, right? - Mm-hmm. Why don't we go back to our place and have some drinks, and we can talk? Cool. What you working on? This is a formula meant to increase a speedster's velocity that I've been developing since Zoom showed up on my Earth. Ironically, this was meant to help out Jay Garrick. You want to give Barry a drug to make him run faster? Temporarily enhance the Speed Force in his system, yes. So you're trying to make nitrous oxide for speedsters. Good analogy. Yes, I tried. Five times I tried. Five times I failed. That's what you get when your background is technology and not biochemistry. Well, then you are lucky I am here. What does that mean? You've been thinking of this as a mechanical problem, not a biomechanical one. And what does that mean? When a speedster runs, they consume an extraordinary amount of oxygen, so we just need something to give an extra boost of oxygen during that time. Like an oxygen generator. Exactly. So we just need a chemical that's rich in oxygen that would release it as a nearly pure gas as it decomposes Something like Both: Sodium chlorate. Then all we'd need is heat to release the oxygen. Which a speedster generates naturally in the form of lightning. I think something like this just might work. You think you can help me figure it out? I can certainly try. I'm not changing my nickname. I like Speedy. Are you familiar with my body of work? If you are, then you know I can come up with something so much better than Speedy. Why don't you get a haircut? And then maybe we can talk about it. I think you're just mad because my conditioner game is on point. So the CEO of Palmer Technologies is living with Oliver Queen. It's insane how much life can change in six months, huh? Which you would know better than anyone, considering that there's another Flash, another Dr. Wells, from another earth. I mean Yeah. No, it's been trippy lately. I wonder what Oliver's doppelganger would look like. - Bald, pot-bellied - Uh-huh. - Agreeable. - laughs You seeing anyone? - I am, actually. - Good. Patty is her name. She's amazing. You deserve someone amazing. Thanks. oven timer dings gasps My pigs in a blanket! Hey, Ollie, um look, I'm sorry that I laid all of this on you. - I know that it wasn't fair. - sighs It's okay. I'm sorry if earlier I was a little Snippy? I have been called worse. No, but I'm glad that you're here. I'm glad you reached out. It shows a real maturity, and I would know that because I've never been that mature. laughs I'm always here for you. Thank you. I got to say, this isn't the same Arrow team I'm used to seeing or the same Oliver Queen. - You seem really - Happy? - Happy, yeah. - I am happy. I finally have everything that I've ever wanted. Being with Felicity has given me a real sense of peace, something that I haven't had in a long time. Didn't you tell me that guys like us don't get the girl? Yep. I was wrong. laughs I would like to propose a toast. I wish it wasn't just the dark times bringing us together. But it is friends like you that make those dark times worth having. chuckles What a guy. Steals my drinks, steals my words. As I was saying, it's good to see everyone. - Yes. - Cheers. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - clears throat - Mm. Look, don't worry, all right? We're gonna keep her safe. - I promise. - Yeah, I know. Look, there's something I never told you. The first time I kissed Kendra, I got a vibe. No, not like that kind of vibe. - Like, I vibed vibed. - Oh. Remember the man with wings? It wasn't a man. It was Kendra. She was, like, a bird. You think that she's a meta-human? Mm Wait. Why didn't you say anything about this sooner? Well, I didn't think it was related, but I guess now it has to be. Look, I don't want her to know about my powers. I have this great thing going with her. She laughs at my jokes, and she loves movies, and I just I've never felt like this before, and I don't want to sabotage it. I get the feeling. gasps Look! I will always find you, Chay-Ara. - Don't move. - Then how will I kill you all? dramatic music grunts Yeah, I can do that too. Thea, no! What did you do? I ended it. This is why we ask questions. Wait. W-where did he go? Both: Oh, boy. sighs Okay. Thanks. All right, Lance is gonna call if he gets any information on whoever that is. I know where we can get some info. Kendra, I have powers. I get these vibes from people. They're visions of meta-humans, and I had one of you. So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human, and, B, she's a meta-human? I don't know. In these visions, you could fly. It was like you were a bird of some sort. - A bird? - Yeah. What else did you see? That's it just you with wings. Oh, I did not see that one coming. Oh, I think there's a lot you didn't see coming. - Great. More surprises. - Who the hell is this? It's my dad. computer beeping rapidly I think I did it. What do you know, Snow? I think you did do it. - Velocity-6? - Ah. This is what was so urgent, Harrison? You get me to come here so I can take your speed drug? That's right. - You knew about this. - Of course she did. She figured it out. I thought this was to help Barry. It is to help Barry, which is why we need to do test runs on subjects who once had the Speed Force in their system. The Speed Force doesn't work like that. It's not something you can create in a lab. How do you think you became The Flash, Garrick? By me and a lab. Science is what did this to you, to Barry, to Zoom, and science is what we need to stop Zoom, and this is our only option. Find another one. The Speed Force can't be replicated or enhanced. It's a living thing. It's a gift that was given to me. That drug you have no idea what it's gonna do. I'm not going to let another one of your experiments mess with me again, Harrison. You find someone else to be your guinea pig. Jay. Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry. - Where are you going? - To pick up what we need. Wait. Jay just said we shouldn't give it to Barry. We're gonna do what we need. The man you're looking for is Vandal Savage. Vandal Savage? Never heard of him. Well, who is he? Some say he was the most trusted adviser to Genghis Khan. Others say he guided Julius Caesar through the Gallic Wars. But one thing the League knows for sure He was there for all of it. So what are you saying? He's like a vampire or something? Not a vampire, an Immortal. Okay, we've officially stepped into crazy town. Immortality? Wait. No, no, no, this makes sense. This explains why he looks the same as he did in 1975. This can't be possible. There's nothing you can do to save her now. Kendra, do not listen to him. I I just need some air. Hey, we're gonna do whatever we have to to keep Kendra safe, whether you think we can or not. Hey, Joe, it's Patty. I just interviewed a weapons expert about the flint knife our attacker used. Found out something pretty interesting, uh, so call me back. Harrison Wells? Kendra! Hey, you going to be all right? It's just a lot to take in right now. Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about me before. I didn't want things to be different between us. It's not that, Cisco. If what everyone's saying is true And it's beginning to seem like it is My whole life just changed, and I am so not ready for that. I hear what you're saying. I do. When I first learned about my powers, I remember feeling that exact same feeling, and sometimes I still feel that way, and all I can say is every day gets a little bit more normal. I promise you. Thank you. You're so welcome. dramatic music   - Aah! - Kendra! Help! Guys, did you find anything? Both: I'm on it! Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is my house. Don't worry. We're going to find her. Wow. You look as beautiful as ever. Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu. Do you remember? Look at me. - You need to wake up. - What are you talking about? I don't know who you are. You will once you emerge. Until then, you need to stay by my side so that I can protect you. Protect me? From what? The man who's hunting you, Vandal Savage. I got them! 57th Street tower. I'm right near there. Always a pleasure watching you work, Smoak. Yeah! - Ow. - That was pitiful. I know this is a lot to take in, but you sort of just kind of have to trust me on this. I sighs Just one second. Stay right there. I got eyes on him. - Give me the girl. - Not gonna do that, Robin Hood. - You're making a big mistake. - I'll take my chances. Barry, change of venue. Birdman and Oliver are at On my way! dramatic music - We need to expose his wings. - I'm open to suggestions. - Now you're listening to me? - It's your city, Oliver. All right. That's new. chuckles Yep, comes in handy. We can't use that serum on Barry. That's up to him, isn't it? If Barry wants to stop Zoom, this is what he needs. Jay said it could hurt Barry. Well, Jay's a coward. Jay's a scientist who knows a lot about speedsters. You're a scientist, Snow. You've been watching Barry. You know he's nowhere near as fast as he needs to be. This other mentor, this other Harrison Wells, did not want him to reach his full potential I do. You know, you're really starting to sound a lot like him. Put your hands in the air. - Who are you? - You're under arrest. Doctor McGee was right. - She did see you. - Christina McGee? At Mercury Labs. You're Harrison Wells. Yes, I'm Harrison Wells. - I'm not the Harrison - Stop! You move closer, and I'll shoot. Give me that Oh, my God, what have you done? Harrison? Harrison, stay with me. Harrison, Harrison, stay with me. Stay with me, Harrison, come on. - Why did you shoot him? - I thought that was a gun. - I'm sorry. I'll call 911. - No, don't! - Why? - Because this Didn't Joe West explain this to you? - No. - Just call Joe. Okay. Where is she? What's your name? You're putting her in danger, and I'm the only one capable of saving her. You have a very interesting perspective on what the word "saving" means. She's the love of my lifetime, sweetheart. I was not gonna hurt her. You need to let me go. Chay-Ara. My name is Kendra Saunders. In this life. And I am was Carter Hall, but that is not who we are. What does that mean? You're Priestess Chay-Ara. I'm Prince Khufu. And we're lovers. Soul mates. We've been partners for 4,000 years. We're drawn to each other in each life, and after we die, we reincarnate to find each other again and again and again. And now that I've found you, we should really get out of here. Okay, Romeo, why don't you pump the brakes? These people cannot protect you from Savage any longer. Do you know who Vandal Savage is? In every lifetime, he hunts us down and kills us. He's done it 206 times, and I'm not planning to make it 207. Why does he kill you? His life force is tethered to ours. Every time he kills us, he becomes more powerful. You do the math. You're 0 for 206, and you still think you're her best bet, hmm? Okay, so what we need to do is just find Savage and get rid of him. Well, you can't get rid of him, my friend. Oh, yeah? Watch us. It might be harder than you think. Is that the only way this guy knows how to enter a room? My associates tell me Savage left Star City a few hours ago. - For where? - We're not quite sure. But I assume after his run-in with you, he realized he needed something more powerful to complete his mission. We think he's trying to locate the Staff of Horus. Sorry, what is that? It's a relic from our past An ancient and powerful weapon. If Savage gets his hands on it, it's going to be nearly impossible to stop him. Since when did our lives suddenly become an "Indiana Jones" movie? - Felicity? - Yeah? - Think you can find it? - Yeah. It's probably at some museum somewhere. I'll, uh, work my magic, see what I can find. We're running out of time. You need to emerge now. Come on, what is it gonna take for you to believe me? You saw my wings. I know you know this is true. Please, just let me show you how. - How's he doing? - He's losing oxygen. - I need you to leave. - Joe, I Patty, go. There's a bullet in a branch of his pulmonary artery that's blocking off most of the blood flow from the left lung. Are we able to get the bullet out? Not without causing too much damage. I need Jay's help. wind whistling So you just want me to jump. Fall, jump, swan dive, whatever suits you. Just, uh, do it. Okay, this isn't the X Games. And this is how she emerges She just falls towards her death? Yep. 4,000 years of experience says that's exactly how. Just watch and learn. No, I'm sorry. What are we doing? Why are we listening to this guy? Come on, Oliver, you're supposed to be the one who asks questions. Okay, but after what we saw, after what Cisco said, I cannot believe I'm going to say this, but it kind of makes sense. Hey, hey, hey! dramatic music   - I need to try. - Are you serious? - Yes, she is. - screams - Barry! - screaming - What the hell was that? - Saving her life. You should have emerged. Something is blocking you. Well, we should just try again and see what's - No! - Yeah, no, no, no, no. We're not doing that again. Kendra, you don't have to do this. Oliver, we can stop Savage, okay? Barry. Barry! What? Talk to you for a second? Okay. Keep an eye on him. What is going on with you? I'm trying to keep her alive. - Then I think we let her jump. - Are you kidding? Barry, I get that you're desperate to help and you want to be the hero and you want to save her yourself, but I think she has to have a part in it too. scoffs It's just the rules keep changing. One day I have to run through time, the next I'm fighting a telepathic gorilla, and now we're what? We're chasing down an immortal madman on a rampage against down a reincarnated warrior priestess? I just never thought I'd have superpowers and feel more powerless than I ever have in my entire life. That part I understand. But you have already helped Kendra. You have kept her alive. So now let's help her get her wings, and then she can give you a lift back to Central City. Central City. What? You need to check Central City for the staff. Kendra, you said you were drawn there. Yeah. I think you're drawn to things that destroy you the same way you two are drawn to each other. That's why it wasn't in any museum or private collection, because it was consecrated eight months ago at St. Mark's in Central City. We've got to get it before Savage does. - Carter, stay here. - I'm not going anywhere. Call Thea and Digg, and we'll have them hold down the fort in case Savage shows up. Kendra, last year, I lost my powers. The only way I could get them back is if I just forgot about everything happening around me and focused on who I was. Just believe in yourself, and your true self will emerge. Thanks. Hey, are you sure that you want to do this? If this guy's immortal and Merlyn's right about how powerful this staff is We'll be fine. Kiss her. We'll be fine. - Careful. - Let's go. exciting music Now what? His systolic pressure's dropping. He's gonna code. How bad is it? There's a bullet in his pulmonary artery. Can you close the wound if I get it? - Yes. - How are you going to do that? What is that? It's a serum called Velocity-6. It could give Jay temporary speed. He can phase through Doctor Wells' chest and remove the bullet. Yeah, but I told you, I have no idea what's gonna happen if I use that. It's our only option. If you don't do this, Dr. Wells will die. dramatic music   Ah! It's working.   BP and oxygenation is rising. Blood flow's returning to his lungs. Thank you. I was just thinking all the moments of my life when I felt different, like something was wrong with me. Now I know why. It's gonna be all right. Okay? Look, I I know what it's like to have your life suddenly change like this. I I can help you get through this. I don't know if you can. Cisco, there's a whole other life inside me, hundreds of lives, that I need to know about. I think I need to do it by myself. I have to embrace my destiny. I have to believe. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't have to do this. exhales deeply - What's going on? - Nothing. I just like to speed into rooms, usually. Uh-huh. Where do you think we find this thing? I haven't been in one of these places in a while. We're too late. Something you're not used to saying very often, I'd imagine. You tried those arrows once before, remember? They didn't quite finish the job, now, did they? I'm not gonna make that mistake again. You're gonna leave Kendra alone. I can't do that. While my destiny is to live forever, Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now. - Any ideas? - Oh, now you'll listen to me? It's your city. All right, let's just try to get the staff. - All right, on my mark. - All right. Carter was right. Something's holding me back. Maybe it's Central City or you or what I thought my life was gonna be, but I'm never gonna become who I really am unless I let go. I have to do this. speaking Egyptian Arabic In all my countless years, I've never encountered anybody with your capabilities. Astonishing! No! Chay-Ara. Oh, my God! laughs Whoo-hoo! I used to enjoy slow deaths. Now I just find them boring. explosions - Thanks. - Yeah. Any chance he blew himself up in there? Not likely. So that's, like, a tie, right? - I guess. - I will take it. Whoo! Hey. You okay? I'm gonna have to learn how to use these things. You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl. monitor beeping inhales sharply Dr. Wells? You're gonna be okay. That's good news. You will probably be very sore for a little while, though. Sore is better than dead. Yes, it is. How are you doing, Garrick? Your serum's out of my system, and I will never take it again. Jay thank you. You can thank me by keeping that Velocity-6 away from Barry. That was Oliver. Savage has the Staff of Horus. He wants us all in Central City as soon as possible. Okay, well, Laurel's already there visiting her mom, so I'll call her and let her know we're coming by. If Savage is in Central City, then why are we going back there? So we can end this. And if anybody's gonna take down Savage, it's going to be Barry and Oliver. Plus, you've emerged. It's going to be much harder for him now. And together, all of us, we can take him down once and for all. Okay, so how are we gonna get there? Did I mention I'm the CEO of a big company with a private jet? upbeat music Since when is that a thing? About eight months. Maybe if you save Star City, you might get one too. By the way, we still need to get Savage. We'll get him. Watch yourself, buddy. You don't want to lose this guy. - Thanks, Mister. - Yeah.   dramatic music
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats. And I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on "The Flash" You're just letting us go? Just remember who it was made sure you didn't get thrown on that plane. I call it the Wizard's Wand. Captain Singh mentioned there may be positions available on your anti-meta-human task force. - Why do you want to do this? - Mark Mardon killed my dad. James Jesse, Your Honor, AKA the Trickster. You're going to prison either way, James. You stay away from me and you stay away from my father. If he finds out that he might have a son that grew up without knowing him, it would crush him. Jesse's my daughter and Zoom has her. You're next. Go ahead. Kill me. But my daughter is innocent. Please Let Jesse live Go on. Say something! Merry Christmas. Whoo. I had to fight some old lady for the last one. They didn't have any Green Arrow dolls. Don't know why you'd want a toy of that crazy man. I can't figure out what to get Barry. I was thinking you could give him this. Oh, that's nice. But I kind of want to get him something more meaningful. I mean, it's been a strange, emotional 12 months. Yeah, you don't have to tell me. Oh, I know, babe. I miss Eddie too. How about you get Barry a really nice watch? Like Grandpa Ben gave to you. That ain't a bad idea. You know, my dad only gave me this watch because I was always late. - You? - Yeah. He always gave a gift with a not-so-hidden message, like this watch or the time he bought me free weights because he said I was too skinny. I told him, "When I have a son, I'm only giving him fun presents." This thing barely works. Don't know why I still wear it. Because it's from family. You sure you're all right? Yeah, yeah. I promise. You know, we should really be more professional. You do realize you initiated that. Yes, and I'm fully prepared to reprimand myself then. I'm just saying, you know, anyone could walk in, like, Joe or Captain Yo. But I have, like, a 4:00 to 12:00, but - I'll see you later. - Yeah, all right. - I'll see you for Christmas. - Yeah, okay. Bye. I'm so happy for you. Truly. Thank you. It means a lot to me that you like her. I don't know. Wells, um, he left me that message where he said that I'd never really be happy. And for a while I really started to believe him, but, now I I don't know. Maybe there is a way to Are you okay? What's wrong? I'm so sorry. I can't keep this in anymore, Barry. I know I was so mad at you and Dad for not telling me that you were The Flash, but when I found out about this, I didn't know what to do. What? What's going on? When Francine came back, my Dad told me not to trust her and he was right. I didn't know how much. When my mother left us, she was pregnant. She had a son. Joe's son. My brother. What's his name? Wally. Wally West. When I found out, I told her to leave and never come back and to never tell my dad, but Barry, I feel I feel like this is hollowing me out. Every time I look at Dad, I feel like I'm hurting him. I don't I don't know what to do. I think you know what you have to do. I can't. It's gonna kill him. No, it won't. You don't have to do this alone. We can tell him together. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, look. Snow. Maybe it'll be a white Christmas. That'd be nice. I was thinking that if we could inject an unstable neutrino burst into the individual breaches, it might cause them to seal on their own. And stop Zoom from travelling back and forth between our worlds. At least then we wouldn't have to worry about him sending any more meta-humans over for Barry to fight. - It means a lot. - What does? You looking after Barry. He's been through a lot the last few weeks. Barry's not the only person here I want to keep safe. Oh, dear Lord, just kiss already. - Oh, the thirst is real. - Is everything all right? Yeah, I keep checking, but all is quiet on the meta-human front. Hey, you think Zoom decided to take Christmas off? What's Christmas? Oh, well, it's this holiday we have where we cut down trees and sing songs to celebrate the birth of a baby 2,000 years ago, and then the Romans killed him so we give each other gifts That's your explanation? - I know what Christmas is. - Oh, right, of course. Um, you know, Joe and Barry and Iris are having people over for Christmas Eve, and they said we could invite whoever we want. - Who who do you want? - You. I want to invite you, I mean. This is so painful. Have you guys seen Harry? Uh, no, I have not. I told him to rest. He's just as stubborn as all the rest of my male patients in this place. I'm gonna leave you two alone, okay? I'm gonna go find Harry. Holy Hannah! - Hi. - Hi. - Everything okay? - Sure. Why wouldn't it be? Why wouldn't it be? Man, it's really coming down. The news didn't say anything about snow. Maybe it's a Christmas miracle. Let it snow. We got a code Aah! Knock, knock. So. Early parole. You interested? Don't mean to be a noodge, but the exit is upstairs. Just need one more thing. _ You got to be kidding me. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Please tell me this is not happening It's official, Santa hates us. This sudden blizzard took out cameras and the security system. I mean, thank God nobody was killed, but there's no trace of Mardon, Jesse, or Snart. Speaking of which, with Mardon back on the scene Yeah? Patty might not be thinking so clearly. What do you mean? What does Mardon have to do with Patty? We should have expected this. The unexpected drop in barometric pressure had to mean Mardon was back in town. Patty Jesse was on full communication lock down, but that doesn't mean Mardon and Snart weren't in contact. Patty, Joe told me about Mardon. I can't talk to you about this. Hey, Patty, it's okay. Got it. Look, Barry, you're a really sweet guy, but you have no idea what's really going on in this city. I mean, you don't even know that Harrison Wells I'm sorry, I don't have time to bring you up to speed. That's ironic. Patty, Patty, look I care about you a lot. I don't want to see you do anything reckless. I'm a cop. Going after criminals is in my job description. It's not reckless. And powers or not, Mardon's gonna answer for what he's done. Patty  Deck the halls   With body parts from a girl named Holly   Fa la la la la, la la la la  I don't remember those being the lyrics. I am tremendously creative. That I can tell you. You'd better be. I didn't break you out I didn't break either of you out, because I was looking to make some new friends. That is not the holiday spirit, Marky-Mark. Christmas is a time for togetherness. And what says togetherness more than mass graves? - Hmm? - So why did you break us out? Well, I owed you one, and this guy, he's just crazy. It's a compliment. And we all want the same thing. - Fashion advice? - To see The Flash dead. Well, that was more of a New Years resolution, but, hey, I'm flexible. That hasn't gone so well for anyone in this room. What makes you think you can stop him this time? Three against one. Plus, the one isn't quite what he was. See, another speedster dressed all in black nearly took him out a few weeks ago. He's vulnerable. He's weak. It's a mistake to underestimate him. With my power, his flair, and your smarts, we can put him in the ground for good. - Tell me your plan. - Tell me you're in. - I'm thinking about it. - What's the matter? A few months in the clink make you soft, did it, Snart? - You wanna dance? - Boys, boys, boys! Play nice! Mellow out, Mardon. Don't have a snit, Snart. Here's an idea. We all go out, have a few drinks, kill some carolers. We'll all feel better. All right. So what's it gonna be, Snart? Oh, yeah. The Weather Wizard, Captain Cold, and the Trickster. There's three of them and one of you. I do not like those odds. And I'm gonna be no help without my speed, so Oh, oh, light bulb up here. I have an idea. Most weather phenomena are marked, no pun intended, by the change of electric charge and pressure in the atmosphere. We could just map out those fluctuations To pinpoint his location. Right, it would just be a matter of removing all The electricity from his immediate surroundings. Attracting it to one spot. The same way a lightning rod does. Only instead of a lightning rod, we could use A wand? Have we already had this conversation? - Kind of. - What does that mean? All right, so the last time Mardon attacked, he, um, generated a tidal wave that destroyed all of Central City. So why are you not all sleeping with the fishes? Earth-2 has "The Godfather"? Every Earth has "The Godfather," Vito. So I ran back through time. One day into the past and I got a do-over and I stopped Mardon before he could hurt anyone. You shouldn't have messed with the timeline. That's what the other Wells said. So the good news is, in that timeline, you created The Wand and it worked. So you just got to do it again. For the first time. - Yeah, no pressure. - I can give you a hand. - Best of both worlds? - I like that. You good, Harry? Yeah, why wouldn't I be? Holiday blues? It can't be easy knowing Zoom still has his daughter. Yeah, all right, look, I'll be right back. I have something I have to deal with. Hey. Okay, the last time the two of you were looking at me like that, it was when you both took my convertible on a joy ride and wrapped it around that big oak tree on Fairmont Drive. Dad, um All right, Joe, we have something we need to tell you. No, um I have something that I need to tell you. It's about Francine. When she left us she was pregnant. Did she have the baby? Yes. His name is Wally. Wally West. Short for Wallace. That's what we were gonna name you if you were a boy. I only found out a couple weeks ago. Dad, I am so sorry that I didn't tell you sooner. That's why she reached out to us after all these years. She wanted us to know before Before she died. And I thought Francine was running out of surprises. I got to get to work. Dad, listen Dad. I'm I'm sorry. Just let me sit with it. Do you think that he's gonna be okay? I do, yeah, I think It's just a lot to take in. He just needs a little time to process it. Ho, ho, ho. Mmm. Cocoa isn't cocoa without the mini marshmallows. And you're out. I checked. Are you out of your mind? Breaking into my home? Careful. I made an upgrade to the cold gun. If I release my grip from the handle, the core goes critical. You might make it, she won't. Read your article on the disappearing middle class. Strong point of view. Nice prose style. Yeah, well, who needs a Pulitzer when you have a homicidal maniac's seal of approval. Didn't Barry tell you? I had a rough childhood. Everyone in this room had a rough childhood. - Get over it. - Why are you here, Snart? I got the Noel spirit, wanted to give you a gift. Mardon broke Jesse and me out to kill you. Jesse's on board, of course. He's shaking with excitement. Me, I'm gonna pass. Why? You grow a conscience? Mardon wants revenge. Jesse wants chaos. I'm just not invested like they are. You mean there's no money in it for you? I was never much for non-profit work. If you're not in with them, then tell me where they are. Nah, consider me more of a secret Santa. Besides, you and your friends love to solve a good mystery. You are full of it, Snart. I think my friends and I saved your sister's life and you can't stand owing me a marker. I hate to break it to you, but that that right there is called honor. Go on, make your pitch. I can see you're dying to. Help me stop them. Sorry, I'm not interested in being a hero. Well, you're doing a pretty lousy job of being a villain this week. Merry Christmas, Barry. Hey. I was just thinking about a big drug bust that me and Singh made about ten years ago. Afterward, we went for a steak lunch to treat ourselves for a job well done and while we were ordering, I got this feeling in my chest. Like my heart was being squeezed. I knew something wasn't right. So I called your school and the nurse said to me that she was just about to call me. Iris was on her way to the hospital. When her appendix burst. And I knew it. I could feel it, right here. I knew my kid needed me. So if I have that feeling as a parent, why didn't I feel it from my son? Joe, it's not your fault that you didn't know about him. Yeah, it was. When Francine left rehab that last time, I should've looked for her. I'm a cop. I could've found her. Brought her back here. Tried again. Tried harder. You were protecting Iris. I've been telling myself that for 20 years. A 20-year lie, but I wasn't protecting her, I was protecting myself. I couldn't stand it anymore. I couldn't I hated not being able to help Francine. So it was easier for her to be dead. Out of my life. Out of our lives. But it wasn't for Iris. I was being selfish. And that poor boy paid the price. Joe He never had a father to read to him at night, show him to throw a football, to make him feel safe. And loved. Who taught him how to be a man, Barry? "Him." I can't even say his name. What have I done? Joe, look, you have been there for me every day since I met you. You have. You would have done the exact same thing for him if you could have, I know it. I'm sorry. Where's your partner, Spivot? I don't know, I'm not his babysitter. I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure where Joe is.  Flash-y the red-nosed speedster   Had a very shiny suit   And if you ever saw him   You might even want to puke  Merry Christmas, kiddie-winks. I'm back! Get TARU down here now. I want to know how he's doing this. Citizens, you know, the holidays can be a time for gentle reflection on the year past. Our ups and downs, our triumphs and heartaches, but don't forget, it can also be a time for disemboweling our enemies. We don't have a Trickster on Earth-2. He's one of a kind. My stocking won't be completely stuffed until it's filled to the brim with bloody Flash parts. So what do you say, speed freak? You wanna roast chestnuts? I want all tactical units on high alert. Get in touch with other precincts, I want watch commanders coordinating deployment. Spivot, I need you to Spivot! Are there any clues as to where he is based on the video? None that I can see. Guys, there's a reflection of something in his cornea, see? - What is that? - Not sure. That's Mr. Jiggle Wiggle. - Come again? - It's a doll. A stuffed children's toy. I gave one to my daughter when she was six. Mr. Jiggle Wiggle was manufactured by Okamura Toys Yahtzee! Okamura once had a shipping facility in Central City that shut down four years ago; it's been abandoned ever since. What if Weather Wizard's there? The wand's not finished. The Trickster is. What are you doing here? Same thing as you. Trying to catch a murderer.  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel   I made it out of clay  We can't let Christmas hog all the holiday fun! Happy Hanukkah!  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel  I made you out of C-4! Put that in your pipe and smoke it!  Oh, dreidel, dreidel, dreidel  I'm afraid we are definitely looking at closed casket funerals. There's nowhere for me to run us to! - So what should we do? - Hold me. - I'm seeing someone. - Me too. Don't let go. Detective. It was all just a trap for you. Mardon and Jesse aren't even here. - They're still on the loose. - How did you know to come here? Because there was a reflection in Jesse's eye of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle. And that's the thing that my dad It doesn't even matter. That's why you came here alone without any backup? Because of your father? You don't know anything about me. I know that you're being reckless. And I'm sure the people in your life care enough about you to not want to see you get hurt. Except Mardon didn't kill my father. I did. See, he had a little shoe shop, and we didn't have any money, so I worked there after school. Except one day I decided not to show up, because I was being stupid and silly with my friends. I didn't even call to tell him that I was ditching. So he brought the deposits to the bank, not me. He was shot and killed by Mardon, not me. That's why you became a cop. Joined the meta-human task force. It'll be legal when I kill Mardon. I have made my whole life about getting justice for my father, even if it meant I didn't have a life and now I met a really great guy, and that doesn't even feel real to me and I'm scared he's gonna find out how angry I am. I don't even know why I'm telling you this. Sometimes it's just easier to say things to someone with no face. Thank you for saving me. You know, even if you get this guy that wronged you, it doesn't always make things better. It has to be better than this. Patty, it's me. Again. I'd really love to talk. I'm worried about you. Anyway, just give me a call when you get a chance, all right? Thank you. Bye. - Barry. - Yeah? How's it look? Wow, eerily familiar. How's Patty? She is, um, hiding a lot of pain behind her smile. They say couples start to resemble each other after a little while. The thing is, I mean, she only opened up to Flash, not me. So even if I could got her on the phone, I don't know what to say. Well, it's been my experience that just being around you can be a big help. Thank you. I want an iPhone, an iPad, and an iTouch. Ho, ho, ho, dial it back, Mr. Greedy. Those are a little out of Santa's price range. How about this? Now remember, don't open it until tomorrow. It's a surprise. Have you decided? - I need more time. - Don't we all. - Decide. - I need more time. Maybe if I go up there and kill a few of your new friends - No! - One more day. I'll tell your daughter you said, "Hello." - What's that? Is that Mardon? - That's definitely him. Atmospheric pressure just dropped 200 hectopascals. - Where? - Central City Square. The tree lighting ceremony. There's thousands of people there. Oh, glad to see you. Maybe you can help me. Help get back to a jail cell? - It'll be my pleasure, Mark. - No. No, see, I'm trying to decide if I should kill everybody down there with a deadly hail storm, or little trickier, with acid rain, what do you think? Ah, let me think, um How about neither? You see this wand here? Guess what? Um guys? He's flying. He can fly? Since when can he fly? Well, he's using his powers to alter the air pressure around him to create pockets of updraft that can No, he can fly. - Barry, get him. - Yeah. You didn't really think I'd let you hurt all these people, did you? No, of course not, but bet you're gonna let me hurt you. Feliz Navidad! Time for a real war on Christmas. What is this? That is a box with a bomb in it. Yup, I've handed out about 100 of them today. It feels so good to give. You see, right now, there are 100 random children who've each taken home a box just like that one and are shoving it under their Christmas tree. There's no way for you to get to all of them, even if you knew where to look. Oh, no. Please don't do this. What? Me? Kill 100 families? No, that's up to you. I'm happy just to take your life. So this is how it's gonna be. You are gonna stand there and let me end you. Very publicly and very painfully and I'll let everybody live, but if I see even a little flicker of electricity on you the casket makers in this town are gonna have a very merry Christmas. So, Flash what's it gonna be? Huh? There you go. - They're gonna kill Barry! - Unless we find those bombs. - Cisco? - Jay, there's no way. There is a way. To find 100 randomly-placed bombs? We don't have to find 100. We just have to find one. And then we get rid of them all. - How? - A breach. That's right. We sent Grodd away. We can do the same to these bombs, all of them. Do you have a drone in your workshop? - Yeah. - Does it fly? - Yeah. - Good. I'm taking it. You're not getting it back. I'll warm up the van. I'm cross-referencing credit card statements with toll road usage and families with children under ten. Hold up Make a U-turn. Two streets back. Your toys. Give them to me. Mom! Flash, you all right? You don't look so good. I know I'll give you a jolt. Oh! Harry, what is the plan? One of the 52 breaches opened by the singularity is 1/4 mile directly above the city. We are gonna use your drone to put this bomb into that breach. Okay, how does that work? One down, 99 to blow. Basic physics, Ramon. Magnetism. Magnetism. Magnets of opposite poles attract one another. Help me out, Garrick. If we can change the dimensional frequency of this bomb and get it through that breach It'll drag all the rest of the bombs right along with it. I'll drive. Okay, hold on. I'm done. He's all yours. Oh, God To think this city worships you! But, when I kill The Flash, they'll realize I'm the man who saved Central City! It's working. - Was that you? - No! Gut him! All right, I'm gutting already. Barry, the bombs are gone. Uh-oh How do you like the magnets, bitch? Detective, it's taken care of. They can't hurt anyone else. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - This is for my father. No, no, no, Detective! Detective, no. You can't do this. He killed my father for a couple hundred dollars. What was so important that my father had to lose his life? Mardon will get what he deserves. - He deserves to die! - Not like this! You don't have it in you, pretty lady. I've been asking myself that for the last four years, and now I know. No, Patty! You pull that trigger, your life ends too. You will go to prison. Everything and everyone that you could have had in your life will be taken from you. Again. Mardon can't take anything else from you unless you let him. I didn't know your father, but I know he wouldn't want this. Not over him. Please. Please. Mark Mardon, you're under arrest. That was beautiful. - Barry, hey. - Hey. Everyone's heading over to our place for Christmas. You okay? Yeah, no, nothing a little meta-human regenerative healing capabilities won't cure. How'd it go with Francine? It was good. It was really good, actually. I mean, I spent so long lying about her being dead that I started to believe it myself. But the truth is, those feelings were always there. That anger, that regret, the guilt I just didn't realize how much I needed to forgive her. And now there's room for another West. Did you meet him? No. He still doesn't know. That'll come. - Wow. You have a son. - I know, right? It's crazy. - Speaking of which, take this. - What? No, no, no, no, I can't take that. I've always said that one day I would give this to my son And now I have. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Love you. - I love you too. - See you at the house. Yeah. I know that you're not him But he's not here and I have to say this for me. In that video message, you said that that I would never really be happy And I've been trying I've been trying really hard. After what Joe said, and helping Patty, I realize that you're still in my heart. How much I hate you for what you've done. I don't want to hate you anymore, I can't. Can't hate you anymore. I forgive you. You need me for something? No, no, I'm good. You know, you should come over for Christmas tonight. You shouldn't be alone. It's a nice offer. I can't celebrate without my daughter. All right.  I saw you comin' down my chimney   I saw you, Santa  - Strong enough? - We'll see. I'll be right back. - Hey. - Oh! What do you have there? - Mistletoe. - What's mistletoe? Oh, um, it's a hemiparasitic plant from the genus Santalaceae family in North America, I think. Caitlin, I'm kidding. We have mistletoe on Earth-2. Right, of course. Um, we also have this tradition over there. We have that tradition here too. - Aww. - Finally. Oh, let me get that. - Eggnog, please? - Yeah. Hi, I'm so glad you could make it. Aw, thank you for having me. Merry Christmas. This is for you. - Thank you. - Of course. - Hey. - Hi. I've been really worried about you. - I've been calling. - I know and I'm really sorry. I just have been dealing with something by myself, but I want to tell you about it. I think that I'm ready to. Someone reminded me of what's important, so if you want to hear, I would like to share it with you. That would be the best gift I could get. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. I don't know. This is a really sweet sweater. I hope it's as sweet as this one. It's matching. - Thank you. - Of course. - Detective Spivot. - Hi! - What brings you here? - Merry Christmas. Well, uh, I'm Barry's girlfriend. - About time. - Cheers. Are we expecting anybody else? - Not that I know of. - Maybe Harry changed his mind. Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son. I'm I'm I'm Joe. This is Iris. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, I just wanted to I don't know. I guess now's a bad time. You've got company, so No. No, no, no. Come in. Time's up, Wells. What's it gonna be? I know what you're doing. I know why you keep sending villain after villain from our Earth to this one. You want Barry to get faster. You want him to get stronger. You want him to become more powerful, more full of speed force. You're fattening him up like a Christmas goose. The more power he has, the more I can take and you're going to help me. Let me see her first. Daddy? Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Please help me. Don't let him take me back there. I won't Now decide. In return for your daughter's life I'll do it. I'll help you steal The Flash's speed
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on "The Flash" When my mother left us, she was pregnant. Dad, I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you sooner. Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son. You want Barry to get faster? The more power he has, the more I can take. - Don't let him take me back there. - I won't. You're going to help me in return for your daughter's life. I will help you steal The Flash's speed. I know I'm moving pretty fast, but stop me if you've heard this one before. Boy meets girl. Happens every day. Except this boy was struck by lightning and became the fastest man alive. So nothing is ever that simple. - Ho! - Oh, my Oh ah Careful! - Oh, boy. - Sorry! - It's all good. - laughing It's all good. Those weren't for me anyway, right? They were. I didn't realize roses were so flammable. Oh, my gosh. Well, it's the it's the thought that counts. And, you know, and proper fire safety management, - that that counts most. - Yes. I have spent most of my life feeling very unlucky. Yeah, and now? Feels like I've been struck by lightning twice. romantic music - whoosh - Aah! Help! gagging Help me Flash, everything you have will be mine. - No! - No! - No! - Aah! gasps suspenseful music   Okay, so there's my desk. Upstairs is anti-crime and the CSI lab that's where Barry works. And we have the open files And that is a pencil. That: stapler. Okay. Sorry, Wally. Obviously, your sister got the funny genes. Captain. I want you to meet somebody. This is my son Wally West. Handsome young man, Joe. Hey, he's a West. He can't help that. Your pops here is a hell of a detective. Obviously not. Well, pleasure to meet you, Wally. Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Wally. Yeah, I've always wanted a baby brother. What about the White Shadow? You're joking, but yeah, we did call Barry that. Well, he's been pretty busy. He's doing a whole lot of running around. But why don't we do dinner? The whole family. I, uh, I got plans. Oh, Iris'll cook. Dad, we just met the kid. We don't want to kill him. All right, we do takeout. Chinese. Whatever. Come on. Where are your cuffs, taillights? Come on, let's go. You know that kid? Uh, no no. You know, it's just what they say. I got one of those faces. I'll see you guys at dinner. Uh, okay. Any chance I could chat with you for a minute? Yeah, what's up, Detective? Oh, uh, I I meant Iris. Yeah, you're not needed. I am needed somewhere. I'ma go there. laughing What can I do for you? Uh, I just wanted to talk with you, um, about Barry. I know that Barry's you know, practically your brother. So I understand that your loyalty is obviously to him, not me. But I was just hoping that maybe you think I'm good for him, so you'd want to help me figure him out. laughs Well, I mean, if you did that, you you would be the first. Wonderful. That gives me tons of hope. both laughing It's just, um he's being not distant, but Guarded. Yeah. He's being guarded. And he's waking up from these bad dreams and not telling me about them. And I know that we got close really quick. It's just it's like there's something holding him back. Here's the thing about Barry. He has a bad habit of carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, burdens that aren't even his to bear. But he doesn't have to do that with me. Which is exactly what you should tell him. thoughtful music   objects clattering Hey no! Absolutely not! You don't get to throw somebody else's stuff when you're pissed off. clattering Thank you. What is this? Wrong answers. Maybe you're asking the wrong questions. What does that mean? I've been thinking about this a lot recently. We keep trying to come up with ways to make Barry faster, but I still think we can figure out a way to make Zoom slower. We tried that already, remember? Those darts didn't slow him down at all. Yeah, I know I'm not talking about the darts, okay? The darts clearly didn't work. They just pissed him off. I'm talking about something else a way we can steal Zoom's speed. suspenseful music   How? The Turtle. As some of you may well know, I've been deeply embroiled in a secret, one-sided battle with an invisible enemy. No, not the Turtle again. What? What is the - Or who is the Turtle? - It's Cisco's white whale. Half whale, half turtle. No. Do you see what you're doing, Caitlin? Everybody's confused now. Get to it. I stumbled upon a few of these cases when we were looking for the Reverse Flash, robberies that were seemingly committed at high speed people holding their beloved items one second. Those items were gone the next. Tell me what you see. dramatic music So he can what? Stop time? No, no, no. Look at the time code. It's still running. Yeah, okay. So if he's not stopping time, what is he doing? He's slowing down everything around him. And that is why we call him the Turtle. Why have you never mentioned this guy to me before? Oh, I don't know, I think we've just been a little distracted, you know, what with Captain Cold and the Weather Wizard and Gorilla Grodd. Do I need to go on? Okay, so if we can catch him, figure out how he uses his powers Maybe we can show Zoom what life is like in the slow lane. How would you even know where to find him? Well, the robberies in the videos all correspond with police reports that were dismissed as lost or missing items instead of thefts. The suspect's M.O. being Items of immense personal value. dramatic music   Uh oh, it appears that there's a press conference at CCPD, because the Vandervoort diamonds have just been recovered. "From Hell's heart, I stab at thee." The perpetrators who committed this heartless crime have been apprehended and are now in our custody. And we're happy to report that the famed Vandervoort diamonds have been returned to their rightful owner. The real gem is the return of my great-grandfather's ring. Getting that returned to the family is what's most priceless to me. Gotcha. suspenseful music   The ring is gone. What happened to it? Lock this place down. No one leaves this room. Sweep the precinct! Well, the good new is whatever the Turtle did, it only affected you temporarily. Yo. What was it like being in Turtle Time? Yeah, no, it was weird. It was like waves of inertness like all the energy was suddenly sucked out of my body, and then it would return. That's because that's exactly what was happening. He has the ability to transfer all the surrounding kinetic energy into himself. Leaving everyone else in a temporary state of potential energy. That's right. So why could I still move? Your speed. Your speed allows you to change positions faster than anyone else. So you can convert your stored potential energy back to kinetic energy. Excuse me, where are you going? Trying to figure out how to use this against Zoom. You remember Zoom? "Cisco, please join me. We'll use your idea and take it to new scientific heights and save the world." Yes, I'd love to! Okay. Facial recognition software found us a match from the press conference footage. The Turtle's name is Russell Glosson. He was a small-time thief who stopped thieving after the particle accelerator explosion. All right, I'm gonna head to work catch Joe up. Let me know if you find anything else. You okay? Yeah, yeah, it's just, um clears throat It's hard to look at that and not think about how I can't help people anymore. Well, we have lots of technology here. Why don't we figure out how to get your speed back? I'm a scientist too, Caitlin. When I first got here, all I did was work on how to get my speed back. Believe me, whatever test you could run I've already done it. somber music   The Turtle. Cisco's been looking for this guy forever. Singh just put an APB out on him. Um, how did everybody know about Glosson before I did? Mm-mm. Cisco's got a whole list of unidentified metas. The boys around here are calling him Cisco de la Mancha. laughs Are you good? You seem a little jittery. A little anxious. Let's be honest. I'm really nervous about this whole dinner tonight with Wally. Come on, why why are you nervous? You're, like, the best dad ever. He'll see that. It'll be a whole lot easier, you being there. Joe, I wouldn't miss it. - See you tonight. - All right. Hey, you. - Hey. - You got a sec? Yeah. I just, um I just want to make sure everything's okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm I'm I, uh don't want to nag. That's not, you know, who I am. I just, uh I don't I don't want you to feel burdened by anything. No, I don't. Okay. Hey, wait. Patty, uh The New Years was always a hard time for me. Um that's when my mom died, so it's just those memories all come out, and they're hard to put away. So if it feels like I haven't been communicating I'm sorry, Barry. I'm sorry. I I didn't know. No, no, no, no, no. Look, um, we haven't had a romantic night in a while. What do you say tomorrow night we get some dinner and drinks and maybe a little kissing? That sounds like what we need. Okay. All right, I'll see you later. - Okay. - both chuckle Okay, I think we can call it. Wally is not coming. I'm sorry, Joe. I know how much this meant to you. He's a kid, right? I get it. He could have at least called. Well, there could be a number of reasons why he didn't. Thank you for being here. I love you. - Love you. - Mmm. See you in the morning, Bar. Yeah. Well, West family 2.0 is not really off to a great start. You've been quiet all evening. The Turtle? How do you know about him? laughing No, um no, I've just had a lot on my mind. Patty? We we may have met for coffee. Iris She really cares about you, Barry, and she's just wondering why you've been so guarded. And what did you tell her? I told her to talk to you. Oh, that's not cool. You know, she did mention that you've been having nightmares. About Zoom killing her. Look. I know that things have been moving pretty fast between you two. But you realize you can't keep things from her forever, right? One day, you're gonna have to tell her the truth. That I'm the Flash? I can't do that. Barry, I wish a year ago you had told me the truth. So, what, you think that I should just tell her? I think that if you are serious about being with her, you have to. musical buildup   All right, then that's what I'm gonna do. I'll tell Patty I'm the Flash. dramatic music Hey. You guys got anything? I think we found the next target for our 30-something, meta-human, not-a-Ninja-Turtle. How long did it take you to come up with that one? It just came out of my mouth did you see that? - That was amazing. - That was nice. Central City Museum is hosting a special black tie event tonight showcasing "The Crystal Ball." It's a famous painting, apparently, recently recovered from Markovia. The painting is on loan to the museum from the Silverberg family. Jacob Silverberg himself said, "The painting's safe return means more to us than all the money in the world. It's like they're begging Turtle to rob it. Okay, yes. This is a plan. So the Turtle will make his move, and we can be there waiting to take him down. How do you look in a tux? Come on, he's 6'2", he's square-jawed, and he's jacked. I think he looks fine. I'm 6'4". Oh, crap! Problem? No. No. An opportunity, maybe. Hold on. - beep - Hey, you. - I'm excited to see you tonight.  - Yeah, me too. Actually, about that um, so I know I said "let's have dinner," but, uh, you've been wanting me to share more. So I thought that I would share that I love art. - Okay, interesting. - Yeah. No, I just, you know, I can't get enough of art. Anyway, there's this event at the Central City Museum tonight. They're showing this really famous painting that I've always loved. Actually, I don't know anything about art, but what's the saying? I know what I like, and I like you, so count me in. All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00. - ALL: 7:00! - Or 7:00. - I'll see you at 7:00. - Okay, 7:00 it is. Bye. You know, you're a really great superhero - Thanks. - A really great superhero - Thank you. - But do you think it's a good idea when you're fighting crime to bring a date? I'm gonna tell Patty that I'm the Flash. Is that a bad idea? What do we think? I will say, she put bullets in King Shark and Harry. - Yeah. - So as far as I'm concerned, that's Team Flash material to me. All right, yes. Thank you, Cisco. Yeah, thank you. Cool. I'm gonna do this I'm gonna tell her. Don't tell her. Huh? You care for this woman. That's nice. Then keep her as far away from this as possible. And here's why. If Zoom finds out who you care for, who you love, who you live for, he'll take them from you. somber music   soft dinner music   sighs All right. Keep your eyes open for the Turtle. A sentence I never thought I would say.   Cisco, are you and Harry in position? I'm the security feed. I've got the facial recognition software running, so we'll be able to spot Turtle before he makes his move. Turtle. Why do you insist on giving them ridiculous nicknames? Me? Who's the genius that came up with "Zoom"? Yeah, well I'll tell you, about two years ago this is on Earth-2, now. The CCPD there they got a 911 call about a hostage situation, but when the SWAT team got there, there were no hostages. It was a trap. Zoom set a trap in order to show the police that they could not stop him. And he killed 14 officers. Men and women. Slaughtered them. Left one alive to tell what happened. That officer described blue lightning "zooming" all about as his comrades, brothers and sisters in arms, were murdered. That officer considered himself to be a lucky one, spared in order to tell the tale. Until Zoom went to his house that night and killed him too. Anyway, that's how he got the nickname "Zoom". somber music   If you ever need me to Vibe so you can know if she's still alive She's alive. Right. soft dinner music continues   - No! - No! voices echoing You have a really weird look on your face. - Do I look weird? - No, no. You look like a dream. You look very handsome. I can't wait to see this painting. What painting? The painting. Uh, yeah. Me too, um, yeah. How about we talk first? I thought you'd never ask.   I can't figure you out, Barry Allen. That is because I work hard to hide who I really am. You don't have to hide with me. I just have to really trust someone if they're gonna know the truth. Do you? I trust you, Patty. I trust you, too. Patty, um After I was struck by lightning, when I woke up suspenseful music We've got eyes on Turtle.   Barry, you were saying? I have to go. I'm sorry. What? What? But Barry CCPD! Freeze!   - crowd commotion - What? crowd murmuring, exclaiming Are you as fast as the Flash? Oh, no. He is much slower. This is a trap? I'm slow not stupid. gunshots exciting music   crystals shattering - Oh, my God! - breathing hard glass tinkling I got it. Come on. dramatic music   Your pupils are normal. Your heart rate's a little low. But other than that, no concussive symptoms. I really do feel fine. What about Turtle? - No sign of him. - Or the painting. He, uh, must have gotten away with it in the chaos. Yeah, things went a little sideways after your girlfriend decided to go all "Lethal Weapon" Oh, my God. Patty's gonna think I ditched her. I no, I got to go. Where are you finding Turtle is what's important right now. Yeah, uh, this is important to me too. But we need to see if your speed still works. I think I think it still works. We still have to find out how Turtle drained him of it. Can I talk to you for a second? You never got your champagne. I couldn't find any flutes. Hope that's okay. Of course. Here you go. glasses clinking Mmm. sighs Let me go see if I can make myself useful. Mmm. knocking on door I was right. I thought that you would look mad, and you do. What happened? Um I don't really have a good excuse. Nothing? Nothing? I mean, come on, Barry. Anything is better than nothing. I mean, come on. Holy crap, I've been a really, really cool girlfriend. Most girls don't have the self-esteem to handle the plans? Oh, no plans. That's cool. Or the or the waking up in the middle of the night screaming again. Fine, whatever. And then and then the really, really fancy plans which were awesome. And then you ditched me right before I almost died. I mean, when you put it that way, it I'm actually really upset. Yeah, I know. Look, we've been having fun. And fun has been so great. But I'm moving past fun to the close part. That's what I want, okay? That's where I'm going. You need to figure out what it is that you want. And do it fast. solemn music   Fast is my specialty. sighs rock music overlapping shouting engine revving   revving tires squealing rock music   tires screeching loud revving indistinct shouting   Yo, pay up. laughs What? You got someone tailing me now? Why didn't you show up for dinner last night? Couldn't make it. You tell someone you're gonna be somewhere, you show up. Guess I didn't have my dad to teach me that, huh? Is this why you came to Central City? Not to get to know me or your sister, but this nonsense? No one in Keystone will race me anymore. But I don't actually have to explain myself to you. Actually, you do. This is illegal. I'm a cop, remember? Oh, yeah. Yes. The detective who didn't know he had a son and who doesn't know anything about me. I am trying to get to know you, Wally. These races that car that I won? That's the only way that I can pay for my mom's hospital bills, get her the help that she needs. You don't have to do this. I have money saved. I can dip into my pension. I don't need your money. I can take care of myself and my mom, okay? I'm the man of our house. That position has been filled. Go home to your family, Joe. jazz music   light knocking   Barry? Hey gasps suspenseful music - thud - Uhh! clattering   What? gasping What do you want from me? The thing most precious to the Flash you. knocking on door Patty? tense music   shell clattering   whispering No, no, no, no, no. No. Come on. No Joe! Joe, um, I think the Turtle has Patty. I Look, just meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs, all right? clicking clicking continues gasping What do you want from me? I want you to stop moving Forever. What do you get out of killing me? Oh, I'm not gonna kill you. That's much too fast and messy. I like to take things nice and slow. You don't have to hurt me to try to prove a point. This isn't about hurting you. This is about hurting someone who values you. Who, Barry? No. The Flash. What does he have to do with this? dramatic musical buildup I saw the way he saved you. Yes, that's what he does. He's a hero. He saves people who need saving. That's a waste of time saving people.   They take everything for granted. So you take the things that matter most to them. My wife Rosalyn took me for granted. She wanted to leave me the thing I valued most. So that's what this is about? You're hurt because your wife left you? I couldn't let that happen. So I made her mine. Forever.   exhales musical buildup   I do hope I spelled your name right. Bar we'll find her. I'm not getting any leads on this guy. It's like he's totally fallen off the grid. You know, it any of the stuff he's stolen, - I can't find it. - He keeps them. He keeps them the way a serial killer collects trophies. He's stolen a lot of stuff. Which means he needs a lot of space to store it, right? That's where we start. See if he rented any storage spaces. No, no I'm not getting anything. Wait a minute. His ex-wife used to be an archivist for antiquities at the Naydel Library before it shut down, and it shut down three months after the accelerator exploded. That place is big enough to hold Turtle's stuff. Okay, all right. Wait, Barry we haven't even figured out how to neutralize the Turtle's power. Well, I'm gonna have to power through it. exciting music   All right, I'm outside the library. Barry, the only way to save Patty is if you grab her in between each of the Turtle's pulses. You'll only have 2/10ths of a second to make your moves. I got it. breathing hard moaning No! gasping muted sound dramatic music   - thud - echoing Uhh! - whack - Uhh - thud - Ugh! - whomp - Ugghh! whoosh I guess he doesn't care about you as much as I thought. No No, no please!   intense musical buildup   - thud - Ooh! gasping whispering No, it's all right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, whoever you are. sobbing whispering It's okay. It's okay. Hey, Turtle. So you want to know my new definition of irony? Now you are our most prized possession. chuckles Arrrhhhh! - Patty okay? - She is, yeah. Jay? Yeah? I know. Why didn't you tell me that you're sick? The champagne. You took my DNA off the glass. You know I lost my husband how hard that was for me to move on. How could you let me get close to you knowing that soon I'd lose you too? I just I didn't expect this. I didn't expect you. Then help me find a cure. There is no cure. The only way to save me is to get my speed back. And the only way to do that is to stop Zoom. Then let's stop him. Yeah. knock on door Hey. I think I left my sweater here the other night. It's green. Oh, yeah. I thought that didn't look like Barry's. Heading back to Keystone tonight. That's a fast trip. Yeah, well, it's getting a little hot in Central City for me. Don't worry. I'll try not to run too many lights on the way there. You know, if you're waiting for an apology, it's not coming. No. No, I'm I'm the one that should be apologizing to you. I felt bad not being there while you were growing up, and I was pushing this whole father-son thing. I'm sorry. Let's just slow down a bit. I won't try to be your instant dad, and you won't have to pretend that you want to be my son. Deal? All that food for you? Doesn't have to be. You like chow mein? No. But I like kung pao chicken. gentle music   elevator dings Initial and sign. There you go. Thank you, guys. Patty. - Hey. - Hi. Um, can we talk like, really talk? Yeah, uh, no. Now's not really an awesome time. I have a mound of paperwork on my desk I need to finish, so I'm sorry, I can't. No, no, okay. Real really quick. Um, so you were right. You were right about everything. Um, I've been closed off and weird, and, um, all the things that you said I was. But mostly, I have not been honest. Barry, um I'm leaving Central City. What? Um, before Mardon, and before my dad before everything I always wanted to be a CSI. And four years ago, I was accepted into the Forensic Science program at Midway City University. That's a really great school. Yeah. Yeah, I know, I just, uh I didn't go. You know, I deferred to become a cop and catch my dad's killer. And I've done that. So, um so it's time to move on. From the job? From everything. Patty. Patty Pat solemn music   Journal log entry number 113. ominous music Jess I'm coming for you soon. I promise. I was thinking earlier today about the time that you were four. I took you to the planetarium, just you and me. I remember because it was the first time I took you out all by myself. The planetarium was crowded, and you held my hand for dear life, or maybe it was the other way around. But it was in the Mars exhibit that I lost you. Panic. I had that place locked down in one minute. I had every security guard looking for you. And I could feel the fear rise in the back of my throat and something else rising also, some dark instinct inside me about what I would do to the person who had taken you the things I would do groaning Unspeakable things. And it was in that moment that I realized, for certain, that I would do anything to get you back. suspenseful music   breathing hard - Gideon. - Yes, Professor Thawne? Where the hell am I? dramatic music
 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on âThe Flashâ I stabbed your mother in the heart and I was free. Eddie is his ancestor. If Eddie dies, he'll never be born. He's being erased from existence. - Gideon? - Yes, Professor Thawne? - Where the hell am I? - I was accepted into the forensic science program at Midway City University. I'm leaving Central City. Joe, you have a son. Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son. These races? That's the only way that I can pay for my mom's hospital bills. Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her. Daddy? Please help me. Don't let him take me back there. I would do anything to get you back. There are many reasons why we run, but usually it's to avoid what's right in front of us A decision to be made or a dilemma we have to face. Lately, for me, it feels like running is all I've been doing. What you got for me, Cisco? You've been playing Good Samaritan all morning. Take a break. Are you sure you don't want to get to CCPD, - give Patty your attention? - No, I can see her later. 'Cause we cannot afford to waste any more time. What, 'cause we've just been sipping Mai Tais since you got here? I don't know what you been sipping since I got here, but Barry needs to get better, stronger, faster. We need to train to prepare for Zoom. Oh, I see. You haven't had your coffee this morning. I had my coffee this morning. Don't slurp. Don't. Don't. Don't. Runaway chemical transport truck heading south on Kester. On it. Hey, I can't stop the truck! Somebody rigged it! Sorry! You can't let that truck crash. If you do, you'll take out a whole city block. Great. Thank you. Thank you for that. That was close, that was close. Oh, and the plot thickens. Uh, dead-end up ahead. You got to get out of there! Oh, come on. Yes! That one was a little close. Nice! Now can you please, please take a break? - How's that for training? - Great. Look, we're gonna catch Zoom. We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline. All we got to do is use him to figure out how to steal Zoom's speed and then we'll get your daughter back. That might take longer than we thought. Why's that? Because Turtle's dead. Barry, we need you back here stat. All right. I'm on my way. Gideon. Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne? I believe it was. I've finally figured out what time period The Flash is from. Now let's figure out a way to get home. He better not be pulling a Juliet. Yeah, that's right. I see plays. - He's dead, Cisco. - How'd this happen? Preliminary brain scan shows an acute brain aneurysm. The night we captured him. How's that for timing? What does that mean? You think I did this, Garrick? This man is the key to us stopping Zoom, the key to me saving my daughter. Why would I want that? Never understood why you do anything, Harrison. That's fine with me, Garrick. Guys, look. We need to figure out how to stop Zoom. Everything we've tried so far has failed. We need to start thinking outside the box. I mean, we haven't even figured out how to close the breaches yet. Maybe that's where we should start. That's a good idea. - I'll get on that. - I'll help. I've got to get to the CCPD. I'll check in with you guys later. Okay. Every time you think that Wells is on your team, something happens that makes you doubt it. Hey, I just wanted to see if you could run this trace for me. Someone messed with an ethanol transport truck this morning. They cut the brake line and tampered with the gear shafts. Okay, yeah. Okay. Wow. Backed up, huh? I am, yeah. Yeah, I guess I'll find out what that's like once I finish CSI school. Yeah, you will. - Yeah. - I guess. Look, Barry, I know that you're upset, but I was hoping it wouldn't be like this between us. Uh What did you think it was gonna be like? I ju I just thought we could at least talk before I left. You're moving. I don't know. I mean, it just doesn't feel like there's much to talk about now, right? I guess not. Hi. - Hey. - Hey. I sort of overheard some of that. Mm-hmm. Um Patty's going to CSI school in Midway City. She's moving in two days. I mean, you don't have to let her leave. She's wanted to be a CSI her whole life. I'm not gonna stand in the way of that. Hey. What's wrong? Just went to see Francine and, uh she doesn't have much time. I already said my good-byes, if If you want to do the same. It's not gonna work. Closing the breaches, that's like solving Einstein's riddle. I solved Einstein's riddle when I was ten. Yeah, well, maybe Earth-2 Einstein wasn't as clever as ours. You realize this Earth is my Earth-2, right? Listen to this. What if we can figure out how to control my powers? We could find Zoom, get the jump on him. That's a good idea. You should get on that. I need your help, Harry. What you need, Ramon, is to figure out what triggers your vibes. Exactly, and I don't know what triggers them. It's completely inconsistent. Sometimes it's when I touch something that belongs to a breacher, sometimes it just happens. There's always a cause. Cause, effect. Doesn't take Einstein to figure that out. Okay, so what is the cause? You saw when I tried to vibe Dr. Light, when I tried to vibe you, took a while to work. Yes. Yes, it did. Meet me in the Time Vault. For what? Hello? Hello? Harry? Of course, now he's gonna make me wait in this freaky-ass braille room. Hi, Cisco. Stop! Don't do that! I figured out your trigger. A rush of adrenaline. Dopamine floods the brain. And the quickest way to achieve that result Fear! Do not move! You can't be. What did you see? The Reverse-Flash. He's here. Oh, my God! Christina McGee. Who are you? You're coming with me. Flash. Eobard Thawne. You know who I am? You died! Good to know. And guess what, Flash. I know what time period you're from. So that means very soon you will die. No. You okay, Bar? I'm good, yeah. It's just a lot. Eddie Thawne died, so Eobard Thawne should have been erased out of existence, right? Not necessarily. It's possible Eobard was in the Speed Force, protecting him like a bomb shelter, keeping him alive and his time line intact. It's what's known as a âtime line remnantâ" A what now? Here, let me show you. This? This is now. Here, today. This is the time Thawne comes from. This is the moment you all erased him from existence, but since Thawne is from the future, this is where his time line begins. That's why he's still alive. This Thawne has not yet traveled back in time to kill Barry's mother. He's here now in this time period for the first time. âTime line remnant.â Explains why nothing's changed. Yeah, it also explains why he didn't know my name or that we have met before. To him, you hadn't. Not until the future. If Thawne dies before he can time travel again, will that save Barry's mother? No. That's not how it works. In our time line, Barry's mother is already dead, and her death is a fixed point. Nothing can change that. All right, well, I'm gonna end this, him, in this time once and for all. Let's find Dr. McGee, then we'll figure out what to do about Thawne, okay? I got to go check on Iris. Ramon. Caitlin, I know you're worried about Dr. McGee, but we're gonna get her back. It's not that. It's Jay. What about Jay? He's sick, and it's getting worse. When Zoom stole his speed, it affected him on a cellular level. We need to do something about it. All right, like what? I think we should replace his dying cells with healthy ones indistinguishable from his. How do we do that? We find his Earth-1 doppelganger. There. Tachyons? A man in a yellow suit tried to steal another tachyon prototype last year. I must have gotten stuck here once before and not been able to access enough of the Speed Force. Tachyons should do it. I want you to isolate and accelerate their energetic properties for me. I don't know if I can do that. If you want to stay alive learn. Franny. Hey. How you feeling today? Better now. I'm gonna let you two talk, okay? Okay. Can I get you anything? Oh, just that brother of yours so all of us can be together for the first time. Yeah, he should be here. His mother is leaving him. Can't blame him for being angry about that. I just wish he'd get all that anger out while I'm here to help. Same thing goes for you, Iris. One thing you learn when you're dying is not to hold anything back. You want to say something to me? You need to say it while you can. I have so many great memories from when I grew up. Now when I think about those memories, I can only wonder what it would have been like if you and Wally would have been there. I'm not angry at you anymore for what happened. I just wish you would have come back to us a lot sooner. Because I would have forgiven you then just like I'm forgiving you now. Mm. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know why this is so hard. I barely even know her. The facial recognition software at S.T.A.R. Labs didn't find anything either. No, but there's still more databases to check. We'll find his doppelganger. - Thanks, Barry. - Yeah. Hey. Hi, Caitlin. Hi. Uh, can we talk? Uh, yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, I'll let you know what I find. - Thanks. - Yeah. What's up? I didn't know you were working with S.T.A.R. Labs. Yeah, um, uh, yeah. Joe and I help out every once in a while. Really? Yeah, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but there's a lot of weird stuff that happens over there. Is that what you came to tell me? Um You're just rolling with the whole âme leavingâ thing. Yeah, well, I don't know what to tell you, Patty. Everyone in my life that I love leaves at some point. Kind of getting used to it. You never told me you loved me. Yeah, I guess I don't get that chance now. I don't understand. What is it? What's going on with you? Why are you being like this? My life is complicated, and I don't want you to have regrets, all right? I don't want you to miss out on something that you've always wanted to do. And I wish that things were different for both of us. You know, but they're not. Sorry. Me too. So what did you do to my goggles? I added a wavelength trigger to stimulate the fear receptors in your brain. Then I took what you already had to induce slow-wave sleep, upgraded it to get you to stage-four sleep. No, this is good. - This will give us more control. - Okay. Now I'll be able to dictate how long you vibe for. Put 'em on. What am I gonna see? I don't know. Never done this before. You'll have to tell me so I can steer you where you need to be. Ramon, you want to find Reverse-Flash, put on the goggles. - Okay. - Attaboy. Go ahead. Oh-ho-ho, yeah, man. I'm in full-on vibe mode right now. - What do you see? - It's hard to explain. It's different events. Different events in time. Concentrate on The Reverse-Flash. Okay. I see him. Move toward him. Okay, now what? Try to picture him with Christina McGee. Where the hell am I? It's charged. You can go now. You said you'd release me. Yes, I did. Didn't I? No! Well, what is it? She's dead. Dr. McGee is dead? Harry and I were trying to hone my powers to find Zoom, and then we ended up using them, finding The Reverse-Flash, and that's when I saw him kill her. And then he left. He left? What do you mean, he left? McGee built him some kind of speed machine and he ran into and got flung back to the future. You'd need superluminal energy to send someone through time. - You mean like tachyons? - Tachyons. We can track their location once they've been activated. - Anything? - Nothing. Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw? - I'm positive. - All right. What else did you see? There was all sorts of weird tech everywhere. There was a clock. What time did the clock say? How how is that relevant? It's 6:00 now. Are you telling me I can see the future? That's exactly what I'm telling you. Those goggles are getting named immediately. But that means Dr. McGee is alive. - That's right. - Yeah, okay. We have 3 hours, 52 minutes to find her and stop Reverse-Flash. Let's do it. - Spivot. - Hey. Can't get away from those case files, huh? Oh, just following up on a hunch. You're gonna miss the action, right? Maybe. A little. - I'm gonna miss you. - Miss you too. - It's nice to know someone will. - Wait, we talking about Barry? 'Cause it sounds like we're talking about Barry. He kept telling me there was stuff he couldn't share with me and I've been going a little crazy trying to figure out what that stuff is. Yeah, Barry's not great at sharing. - Neither are you. - What do you mean? Barry just told me that, you know, sometimes he helps you out with S.T.A.R. Labs stuff. Yeah, he does when he has a few extra minutes. I didn't know that. I mean, the whole time I've been working here you never mentioned it to me, but then I realized why. I went through some of Barry's old cases. All of them involved The Flash saving the day with details that Barry couldn't have possibly even known. That's weird. Yeah, it It is weird. The only thing that does make sense is that Barry is The Flash. Have you ever seen Barry run? He waddles like a slow-ass duck. There's no way he's The Flash, Patty. You know, when I started this job, you told me I had to learn how to lie to do it. You're a terrible liar, Joe. See you. Nice nitrous kit. You're gonna get caught one of these days. You know that, right? Get thrown in jail? I'll stop racing when these hospital bills stop coming in. I saw Mom today. She says you haven't been by in a while. Yeah, she knows why. She thinks it's because you're angry with her. I have every right to be angry. Nothing for 20 years, then out of nowhere, she tells me I have a sister, I have I have a father. Yeah, the same thing happened to me too, remember? But that shouldn't keep you from seeing her before you can't anymore. No. Look that's not what it is. Then what is it, Wally? I got to go. Last year, my fiancÃ© died unexpectedly. One moment he was here, the next gone. I didn't get a chance to say good-bye to him, to tell everything he meant to me, That he was my world that he was loved. But today I got to say good-bye to your mom. My mom. And it helped us both find peace with what happened to our family. Wally, don't make a mistake you're gonna regret the rest of your life. Go see your mom while you still can. No sign of tachyon activity. We're running out of time. We've got to find them. It'll take a few minutes for the device to reach full power once it's activated, but when we find it, you're gonna have to get there fast. - Hey, Barry. - Yeah? Have you found out anything else about Jay's doppelganger? There's no Jay Garrick on this Earth. That's so weird. Everyone has a doppelganger. Maybe just ask Jay. He's a good guy. Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you. Okay. Hey. Hold on. What's up? We got a problem. Patty knows you're The Flash. - What? - She caught me off guard. I mean, I played it off, but come on, she's a smart girl. Anyway, she was going through some case files and you were acting all squirrely. This is my fault now? - No, it's nobody's fault. - Oh, my God. - Maybe you should tell her. - No. - Patty's trustworthy. - It's not even about that, Joe. I-I don't want another person that Zoom or Reverse-Flash or any of these meta-humans can use against me. I don't want it. Patty can't get hurt over this. Tachyons! 87th and Avenue J. Must be one of Mercury Labs' off-site facilities. Hack into their se I've hacked in the security feed. - And once that - I'm one step ahead of you. Uh-oh. Barry, hurry up! It's charged. You can go now. You said you'd release me. Yes, I did. Didn't I? He's gonna kill her. - You okay? - Yeah. Okay, get out of here, all right? Go! Go! That was my way home! You're not going anywhere. You haven't won here, Flash. I'll find another way back. You're gonna have to get through me first. You really think you're fast enough to stop me? Let's find out. Catch me if you can. Oh, it's on. Get him, Bar. Not fast enough, Thawne. I will never lose to you again. This war between us, it ends now! Bar, you got to stop! Bar, don't kill him! Just bring him in! Get the cell ready. Hey, he can't? Phase his way out? No, he can't do that. It's the same cell we used to hold Dr. Wells last year. Barry, where you going? - I'm going down there. - No, you're not. The more he learns about you, the more you will alter the time line. He killed my mom! He's from the future. He hasn't done that yet. He doesn't even know you're The Flash, and you need to keep it that way. You already said that his mother's gonna die no matter what we do. There's ramifications any time anybody messes with the time line, and it's impossible to predict what those ramifications are going to be. Barry, you caught him and you stopped him from killing Dr. McGee. In my book, that's a win. This doesn't feel like a win. I got to go. So, what'd you want to talk to me about? My dad had multiple sclerosis. Every day for years, I watched this amazingly strong man fight for his life and lose. So, I can't sit by and watch another man I care about fight for his life and not do something about it. I tried to find your doppelganger. Same DNA, same cellular structure. I could replace your dying cells with his living ones. But you don't have a doppelganger on this Earth. Caitlin, there is a good explanation. Meet me at Hofherr Park tomorrow and I'll show you. Why can't you just tell me? Because you need to see for yourself. How'd you get your suit in your ring? Who are you? My name is Cisco Ramon. And we know each other well, don't we? We have a history together. You could say that. And that's all you want to know? How I got my suit in my ring? I want you to know that I'm the one who figured out you were back. I helped stop you. Me. And how'd you do that? I have powers. And I helped track you down and I put you in here. That's quite the ability you've been given. And here's what's so ironic about it. You gave me these powers. Have fun thinking about that while you rot away in this cell that you helped me build. Bye, Felicia. Hey. Hey. Got your text. I wasn't sure that you would see me, considering you've been avoiding me lately. Patty, I haven't been avoiding you. No, just, uh, busy you know, speeding around Central City. - I know you're The Flash, Barry. - Patty, come on. Please don't make me feel any more stupid than I already do. Look, I'm a detective and I should have known. I was just I was so smitten with you. Okay, look, what What you're saying, it's insane. Look, you don't have to lie to me anymore, okay? I understand I understand why you didn't want to tell me. I understand why you've been distant. Look, I understand everything. But just tell me the truth now. Just be honest with me. Just admit to me you're The Flash and I'll stay. I can't do that. I'm not him. It's too bad. It would have been nice to stay. Fight crime during the day and be with you at night. But I was I was wrong. Take care, Barry. Is that you, Flash? Why do you hate me so much? I didn't always. I was obsessed with you. For so long, I wanted to be The Flash. I spent years figuring out how you came to be. Duplicated the reaction and it worked. I became like you. Right, so what happened? This ability to travel through time revealed a truth. My fate was to become your greatest enemy. I was never going to be The Flash, so I became the reverse of everything that you were. The more people you saved, the more you were loved, the more I had to take from you. That is why you killed my mother? That's why you ruined my life? Because you couldn't be me? I became better than you! I am the one thing you cannot stop, Flash! No, no, no. Not anymore. Our race is over. And you lost. I've learned what time period you're from, Flash. And one day soon, I'll learn your name. We need you in the cortex now! What's happening? He's experiencing an uncontrollable amount of electrical energy in his brain, putting him in a prolonged state of chronic seizing. What? Can you stop it? I don't know. - Hold him down! - We're trying! - Sedate him, Snow, now! - Come on! Come on! Benzodiazepine. This should do it. Finally. Oh! What? What was that? What's going on? Where the hell am I? - Cisco! - It's the time line. What? What are you talking about? When you when you captured Reverse-Flash, we ruptured the time line. That's what this All the blood and the seizures and that and all Cisco is being affected to to By the changes to the time line. The changes to the past or the changes to the present This is what this is. We need to do something. - We need to do it fast. - Like what? We need to restore the time line. Barry, you need to get Reverse-Flash and send him back to the future as quickly as possible. - What? Are you - Barry I just caught him! You want me to let him go? Keeping him here is killing Cisco! Barry, if this is the only way we can save him, you got to do it! - You got to let go of Thawne! - I can't. Okay, all right, look. I destroyed the tachyon drive in the speed machine. There's no way it'll reach a speed necessary to send him back home. - You can. - What? Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed, that'll be enough to catapult him through the time continuum. You can do it. All right. All right. Let's do it. Let's do it. Time to send you home. The time paradox. Yeah. You've all messed with something you don't understand. Can you do me a favor and just shut up? And how exactly are you going to send me home? Don't worry about it. You fixed Dr. McGee's tachyon device? No, I came up with a different method. Is that so? Uh-huh. Who are you? No one of consequence. No. I doubt that. I win again, Flash. All you have to do is provide him with enough momentum to get him past the space-time barrier. - All right. - Hey, listen to me. Thawne knows about you. Right here, right now. This is where he learns about you, all of you. It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs, how he knows about me The Harrison Wells from this Earth. And there's nothing I can do about it. There's nothing you can do about it. This is his origin story, and it's going to happen no matter what you do. But right here, right now you can send him back to his time. You can save your friend. You can save Cisco and then move on with your life. This could be a good thing. You can finally let go of him. I could throw him three centuries from now. He'll always be a part of me. Time to send you back where you belong. We'll meet again soon, Flash. I know. And every time, I'll be ready for you. Hurry. He did it. He's gonna be okay. I don't understand what we're doing here. Well, just like you, I thought that if I could find my doppelganger on this Earth, I could replace my damaged cells with some of his healthy ones. And believe me, I was just as shocked as you when I couldn't find a Jay Garrick anywhere on this planet. Took me a while to figure it out but eventually I found him. His name is Hunter Zolomon. Hunter Zolomon? Why doesn't he have the same name as you? From what I could gather, his mother died during childbirth. He bounced around from family to family, but eventually was adopted and raised by the Zolomons. But why does that mean he can't help you? My DNA was mutated when I became a speedster. There's only one way to reverse what's happening to me. If we can catch Zoom, I can get my speed back. Then let's finally figure out the best way to do that. - Wally, hi. - Hey. Um, do you want to come in? No, I-I can't stay. I just I wanted to tell you that I'm gonna take your advice and go see my mom. Okay. Iris, I was I was wondering if you would come with me. Yeah, yeah, I would I would love that. - Yeah? - Okay. Um My head feels like it's in a vise. What happened? I think you vibed one too many dimensions. Maybe I should stop doing that. Yeah, he's gonna be fine. How did you, um get the vibing to stop? We sent Thawne back to his time. You let him go? I couldn't let him take another person I cared about. - Thank you. - Of course. Okay, I think I need a Big Belly burger. - Anyone? - I'm good, thank you. - Yeah, no pickles. - Two triple triples, please. You got money? Mmm. Rest up, all right? I'll be out here. So, Patty she's on a train to Midway City right now, huh? Mm-hmm, I had to let her go too. Mm-hmm, I was thinking about what you said, that part of being The Flash is that you have the ability to do amazing things that nobody else can do. And we see now that a hundred years from now, you'll still be doing them. But the other part is, you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices, and you're gonna have hard choices to make, and there's gonna be a lot of things where eventually you'll have to let 'em go. You got to be ready for that. I am. I'm ready. That's my boy. That's weird. - Hey. - Barry, I'm on the train. There's a there's a man with a gun. All right, hold on. I-I-I'll get you help. - Is everyone okay? - Everyone's fine. It was a false alarm, but thanks for coming so fast, Flash. Just want to make sure everything's okay before I go. Don't worry. Everything's good. Good-bye, Barry
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously, on"The Flash" Is this why you came to Central City? This nonsense. I don't actually have to explain myself to you. This is illegal. I'm a cop. The detective who didn't know he had a son. I saw Mom today. She says you haven't been by in a while. She thinks it's because you're angry with her. I have every right to be angry. - I'm leaving Central City. - What? I was accepted into the Forensic Science program at Midway City University. Got Turtle locked up in the pipeline. All we got to do is use him to figure out how to steal Zoom's speed, and then we'll get your daughter back. That might take longer than we thought. Because Turtle's dead. Now, decide in return for your daughter's life. I will help you steal The Flash's speed. People think of tar now as mainly a roofing product. Fun fact: it's also been used as medicine and flavoring for candy and liquor. I bet what you're thinking right now isn't "yummy", is it? What I hope you're thinking is, "Wow, Clay is serious about wanting to know "where I put that money.

I'm sorry, what? gasping Central City Bank account 5463728. panting Please, please, pull me up now. I'm so sorry! Aah! I thought you said you weren't gonna kill him.

He was my hero, so I never thought of being anything else. What about you? No, I wanted to be an astronaut. Wait, that's what Barry wanted to be. - chuckles - Really? Probably not for the same reasons. Going to space is like the fastest a human being can go, so it was either an astronaut or, like, have you heard of scramjets? - Mm-mm. - Okay, they're like supersonic on oxygen, dude. It's nuts. You're right. Not the same reason as Barry. You are really all about the speed, huh? Yeah, I mean, it's what I love. Is that why you're still drag racing? You are, aren't you? Isn't that a little dangerous? Yeah, for the people that race against me. Sure is. Look, thanks for the hang, but I got to go. It's early. Don't leave yet. No, I got some stuff to do. I'll see you later. Why'd you do that? "Thanks for the hang?" Is he your son or age-inappropriate buddy? Look, I know the dynamic is weird. I'm just trying to figure it out. From my perspective, it seems like you're ignoring something that could, oh, I don't know, get Wally killed. The fact that Wally even wants to get to know me is the big win here, so in the future could you try not chasing him out of the house? Look, Dad, I'll play along if that's what you want, but which you exactly are you trying to let him get to know? Because the person that I saw tonight, I don't recognize that dad. Journal entry 1-14: Turtle's brain. So, what I learned from Turtle's brain matter and the Reverse-Flash, as it turns out, has allowed me to complete a device that when installed inside The Flash's suit, will let me harness his speed, so that the next time he taps into the Speed Force sighs I could begin collection. I wish there were another way, but there's not. - Oh, hey. - Hey. You're here late. As are you. Shouldn't you be out doing whatever it is that 26-year-olds do on a Thursday night?

Oh, no, haven't you heard the expression "two heads are better than one"? No. Must be an Earth-1 thing. You understand, for me, that my Earth is Earth-1? - Yeah. - Your Earth has yet to create CFL quark matter, and so it would take you too long to catch up on the science haul. Do it by myself.

You are the star of the piece. I had a little chat with some of your previous associates and dug up some revealing details about you. Like the gambling rings you run or the thefts you've been involved with. I'm sure the CCPD will be interested in this one. You're forgetting something in here. Aggravated assault. You think you're the only one that can play this game? I could find out where you live, what you eat, when you sleep, every little detail about your life. Hmm?

I can stop when I want. So why don't you? You said that you were only street racing to earn money for Francine's medical bills. Well, there are no medical bills anymore, so why are you still doing it? Look, I am not going to pretend that Francine meant to me what she did to you, but in the short time that I got to spend with her, I saw what kind of person she had become. She was smart and kind and loving, so I can't even imagine how much you miss her. You don't know what I'm feeling. Well, let me tell you how I feel. I know that you were trying really hard to convince everyone that you were a badass, but I know that you're a good kid, Wally. And you didn't get that way raising yourself. You had a single mother who cared for you, so my dad and I care whether you wrap yourself around a tree or get shot by one of these gangsters.

Give me back my daughter and I'll get you the rest. You're not in the position to negotiate. You won't kill me and you won't kill my daughter because if you do, then you won't get what you want. I don't need to kill your daughter. groans I can torture her. Bring her right up to the edge of death, so I can do it again the next day and the next. Bring me the rest of Flash's speed. # # Hey. I ran background checks on everyone involved in this Tar Pit mess, came up empty. I mean, they all have records, but they're sealed, so I can't read them. Well, that's 'cause you're bound by ethics, Detective West. How many felonies are we committing breaking into sealed court records? Eh, three or four. Nope, five. Well, they were sealed because the records are all juvenile offense. They weren't arrested together. No, but look at this. They served in the same juvenile detention facility. Actually, Monteleone and victim one were bunkmates. Who do we have shacked up with vic two? Bronwen, comma, Clark. Good luck finding him. He has a ton of addresses and I can't seem to find anything current. I'll run his picture through facial recognition. That won't be necessary. In this case, I am facial recognition. I know exactly where we can find that guy, and, Dad, you are not gonna like how. Okay, you can tell me about it on the way. What is that? Breach implosion reactor. Sorry I asked. You ready? Yeah, let's do it. Have fun fixing the universe, you two. Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? You seem like you're in pain. What? No, no, I have aheadache. If our calculations are correct - And they are. - And they are. When this device detonates, it will collapse the event horizon on this side of the breach, thereby shutting off any connection to Earth-2 permanently. yawns Are you okay? Yeah, I'm just a little tired. I don't feel like myself. I'm good though. Yeah. - It's gonna work, Harry. - Yep, yep. Okay. You ready? Yeah, give it to me. stirring music # # Come on.

I don't know what kind or anything, I just Or maybe you're allergic is she allergic to flowers? No, I'm not, Wally. Thank you. Cool. Um I'll just leave them here. # # It's okay, Wally. Feel better. I'll be back. Hey, hey, hold up a minute. I got somewhere to be. Yeah, you do. At your sister's bedside. Iris came to that race last night because she cares about you. Look, man, this ain't on me. I didn't tell her to go to that race. Look, I know you didn't. This ain't a blame thing. Just hear me out, okay? Look, I know you just lost your mother and you just found us, it's been like a whirlwind. Now, I I can't tell you how to live your life, but I can tell you this: you're not alone. You have people that sit up at night worried sick about you, and they're not going to stop worrying about you. That's what a family does. They put up with each other and they put each other first, before ourselves. So you're not mad at me? For being reckless with your life? Yeah, hell yeah, I'm mad at you. But I'm more mad at myself for being something I'm not. I'm not your friend, Wally. I'm your father. I ain't letting you go. Okay. phone buzzes Oh, it's Barry. Go. I'll stay with her. You sure? Well, she's my sister, right? That's my boy. Don't worry, we're gonna get him. I'm sorry, dude. What? Tar Pit. You shouldn't worry. We're gonna get him with these. With these nitrous grenades. Each of these has ten times the concentration of a hot rod's nitrous tank and is triggered by extreme heat. We're talking 650 degrees. That's the boiling point of asphalt, so one of these puppies makes contact, you got a Tar Pit popsicle for dessert. All right, that's great. Um Hey, look, I think that maybe you were right. I felt slower tonight. You know, not by much, but enough. Well, do you think there's something wrong with the suit maybe? It's unlikely. The readings from the suit are normal. You know I take care of that thing. Yeah, what? Am I sick? I don't know, dude. Feel any different? No, not really. I mean, I know that I'm slower in the moment, but I can't tell by how much. Tests on the components in your blood show the Speed Force at a 100% for the last 60 days until today, it dropped to 98. Zoom stole Jay's speed. Do you think maybe, during your fight with Zoom, yours might have diminished? But that was weeks ago. Why would I just be feeling those effects now? - Dr. Wells? - Yeah. You've studied the Speed Force more than anyone. What do you think could have happened? It could be any number of things. Yeah. All right. I just looked, I mean, Iris could have died tonight. She's gonna be okay, Barry. You know, this time, but the fact is, she is hurt right now because of me. I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris just from some meta-human tonight. When Zoom attacks again, I need all of my speed and then some. I can't lose anyone else. You won't. I did it. What? Whoa, whoa, what is that? dramatic music # # I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom. No, no, no, this isn't What you're working with Zoom? No, not at first. We trusted you. I trusted you! # # Joe, stop! # # Why did you put him in there? Because if I didn't, I would've killed him. Let's go find this tar freak. door whirring - Yeah, what the hell, man? - Shut up. I thought I was being transferred. chuckles You're not being transferred. You're the bait. What? suspenseful music This is for two years ago, Clay. # # crackling # # Stay. grunts You know, it's ironic. I was just saying how much you remind me of the old Wells, and now, here we are, just like I did with him, standing on either side of this glass with me asking you, "why?" I'm doing what I have to do to save my daughter. Yeah, at any cost, right? The cost of Joe's daughter. I told you, "I would betray you."ÃÂ I told you, "I would have to choose." You chose wrong. Really, did I? Because I just sacrificed my daughter. Because I just sentenced my daughter to death to save your son. You want a pat on the back? I want you to send me home. Send me back to Earth-2. Think about it. Zoom wants you to get faster. He wants you to have more Speed Force in you, for when he finally takes it, send me back, use the implosion reactor to shut down the breach. Shut down all the breaches. Close them all and Zoom will never be able to crossover, ever again, and that'll be the end of it. What about your daughter? Jesse's my battle to fight, not yours. poignant music beeping door whirring moans Hey, how are you feeling? Like I could use some pizza right now. both laughing Well, they're letting you out tomorrow, so I can get you any kind you want from anywhere you want. Deal. You know growing up, we didn't have a lot of money to go to the movies or buy toys. Instead, she would just take me in the car, we'd would go for these long drives. Just her and I and her music. I remember being on the road with her and just watching the scenery flash by and feeling so happy. And now, when I race, feeling that rush of speed it's like It's like I get to back to those days. I didn't want to stop because if I do sighs See, that wasn't so hard. Actually, it was pretty hard. both chuckle This is a sample of Barry's cells after whatever Harry did to them. As you can see, not only is it drained of the Speed Force, but it's also presenting itself as chromosomal damage. If Harry kept doing what he was doing, he could have taken your powers permanently. Even Evil Wells couldn't figure out how to do that one. Well, look, somebody better send his ass back to where he came from or I'm gonna shoot him. - Amen. - No. What do you mean, no? What would we have done if we were in his position? I mean, what would you do if it was Iris, Joe? And Cisco, when Snart kidnapped you, threatened to kill your brother unless you helped, you did, and none of us judged you for that. We still don't because when it comes to family, when it comes to the people that we all love, we're all vulnerable. None of us are above making a wrong decision. He could have done it. He could have stolen my speed, gotten away with it. None of us would have even known, but he didn't, and now his daughter's gonna die and we're okay with that? I can't just give up on her. I can't give up on a world. This is a world full of people who are facing death. I don't know, I may not be fast enough to beat Zoom yet, but I'm not gonna just close the breaches and forget about it. We have to help Wells. Look, guys, I I was the one that trusted him first. I own that. I let him stay when literally all of you told me not to, so everything that's happened up until this point, it's on me, but this has to be a group decision. tense music computer beeping Come on. Well I guess this is good-bye. No, it's not. I told you, we're a team. Now you're a part of it. We're gonna help you save Jesse. We're not sending you through alone. We're going to Earth-2.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. Previously on "The Flash" I'm in full-on Vibe mode right now. I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris. I felt slower. I did it. I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom. Give me back my daughter. Bring me the rest of Flash's speed. I told you we're a team. We're gonna help you save Jesse. We're going to Earth-2. Journal log entry 115, my last entry. On this earth, we're closing the breaches, all of them. Soon, every portal between this earth and mine will no longer exist. I've become distracted by this Earth, its problems, its people. But the one thing I never lost track of was you, Jesse. You are my conscience, my beating heart. You're the reason I made it this far in my fight against Zoom, and now I just need you to hang on. Hang on a little bit longer because I'm coming to get you, and this time I'm not coming alone. panting grunts dramatic music Bam. Uhh, that's how it's done. - Ooh. - Whoo. He shoots. He scores. Not bad for a guy who got a C in gym. D plus. Straight up F right here. Can't believe it. We closed all the breaches. All except the one. Our last way to Earth-2. Ready? Yeah, I just have a few things to take care of first. Just a reminder, Allen Clock's ticking. It always is. You know you haven't made lasagna since I left for college? Well, college is a hell of a lot closer than another Earth. - sighs - Hey. Did you tell Henry? No. I look, if he knew, he would just try to talk me out of it and he probably would, so Dad, can you give us a minute? Yeah, I'll make us some coffee. Look, Iris. I know that this is Nuts is the only word I can think of right now, but it's not like I've never done anything dangerous before. Look, I I get why you are doing this. Innocent people are in danger. That's always been the direction that you've run in, even even when you ran a little bit slower. chuckles I just I want to make sure that you're not doing this because you think that you don't have anything left here anymore. melancholy music This isn't about Patty. It's not. I mean, of course, you know, I miss her a lot, but I know what I have here. I love my life. I love my job, being The Flash. - chuckles - I love you and Joe. I'm not trying to escape. I promise. Go win, Barry, and then come home. All right. All right, Barry, listen to me. You're about to go through the looking glass. You're gonna see things that look and feel familiar, but they're not. Up is down. Black is white, and do not let yourself get sucked in emotionally, and good luck. sighs Look, if we're not back in 48 hours, that means that Zoom has us. If that happens, you have to close the breach. We're not gonna do that. You get yourself back here in one piece, all right? Don't make me come and get you. No. solemn music I wrote this for my parents and Dante. If I don't come back, make sure he gets them. Cisco, you're coming back. Caitlin, please. Okay, I will. Thank you. sighs - Be careful. - Yeah. Okay. - You too, Harry. - Snow. I hope you get your daughter back. I'll make sure you get your son back. exhales sharply You don't have to do this. Yeah, I do. Is anybody else feeling panic right now? I chickened out of bungee jumping when I was 18, but this is categorically a lot scarier. Once I turn the speed cannon on, the three of you will be able to pass through unharmed, but Barry, you need to make sure you keep your speed up. Mm-hmm. I I got no spit. - "Jaws." - I'm not just quoting "Jaws." I mean my mouth is really dry right now. Do not get distracted by anything you see along the way. What are we gonna see? Everything. Do it, Jay. suspenseful music   Okay, let's go. dramatic music   electricity crackling and buzzing suspenseful music Caitlin, look out! both grunt - grunts - You okay? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. What happened? With the rest of the breaches closed, the energy surge to this last remaining breach must have destabilized it. Well, what does that mean? As long as it's unstable Barry and Cisco will be trapped over there. tense music   dramatic music roars   panting and sighing Holy 2001. I feel like I just opened my third eye. Oh, my God.   chuckles Come on. Ow.   chuckling   sighs Welcome to Earth-2. airplane engine roaring chuckles Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. This is amazing. Half these things are just ideas on our Earth. - Come here. - I mean Oh, yeah.   - sighs Ramon. - What? Not a sightseeing tour. Speak for yourself. We want our grandkids to know we did cool stuff. - Dr. Wells. - Henry. Welcome back. We weren't expecting you. - Ahh! - Yes I didn't tell anyone I was coming back. I thought you might've left town with all that's been happening. - Right. - Are your friends okay? Yes, they're they're fine. They're excitable. This is, um Henry Hewitt, lab assistant. Pleased to make your acquaintance. And you um, this is Barry. This is Cisco. - I'm Cisco. - Yeah. And you are just a nice, normal guy. Okay, um Dr. Wells, will you and your visitors be needing the conference room? Not necessary, Henry. Our visit will be short. - Okay. - Good to see you. Good to see you, sir. He's a bad guy on Earth-1. He looks just like him. sighs A reminder that a citywide curfew has been issued. No unauthorized person is to be out after 9:00 p.m. A recent increase in Zoom attacks has led Mayor Snart to extend the curfew. The curfew was first issued after a series of terror attacks throughout the city It's worse. It's worse than when I left. Zoom has turned up his reign of terror. All right, then let's find Zoom fast. Cisco, do your thing. All right, Zoom You can run, but you can't hide. tense music   All right, you know what? You guys are crowding my space a little bit. I can't perform like this under pressure, okay? If you could just step back just a little bit, - I need to do my thing. - All right. - My mojo. - Yes, all right. Thank you. Take two clears throat Mm, ah.   All right, Zoom. You can run Ramon, what's happening? You know, I don't know, okay? I can't see anything. I don't know what's wrong. Maybe I lost my powers. I didn't lose my powers. Why would you lose your powers? Oh, here we go, the wavelength trigger's not responding, but that only happens if The frequency is imbalanced. What? Our Earth vibrates at a different frequency than yours. Harry, without that frequency We're up a creek. The latest attack was orchestrated by Zoom, and we understand that citizens of Central City are scared, but I can assure you the CCPD - has been working diligently - That's me. laughing Yeah, it is. Under the leadership of Detective West. We will stop Zoom. That's a promise. "The leadership of Detective West." So Joe's still a cop here. Yeah, but more importantly, I'm still a CSI. I have a plan. dramatic music gasping What just happened? Oh-ho-ho-ho, doppelganger. Wait, wait, wait, wait, how did I get here? What who are who are you? stuttering How do you look like me? Allen, what are you doing? Harrison Wells. chuckles The Harrison Wells. Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs? Okay, I have no idea what is going on here, but I've always wanted to meet you. Your thesis on string phenomenology was revolutionary to me. - Oh, man. - I had the magazine laminated so I could keep it. - I I just want to emulate - This guy's incredible. I won an award for it, right over there, you see? - Oh, it's beaut - electricity crackles Wh wh what did you do? What's wrong with you? Have you turned into an evil you? Relax. Just knocked him out. Oh, well, why'd you even bring him over here? So he could become him. While you guys work on the goggles, I will go to CCPD as him and see if I can figure out what information they have on Zoom's previous sightings. We can use those sightings to triangulate Zoom's hideout. Good. That's a good plan. Just remember what Jay said, okay? Things here are all sorts of trippy. Look, it'll be fine. I can handle it. sighs It'll be easy. elevator dings light instrumental music   Whoa.   chuckles Yo, this is crazy. Get your hands off me. Captain? Look, I don't know nothin', so I ain't sayin' nothing'. Okay. Deadshot, wh laughs That's not funny, Allen. I hate that nickname. Okay, look, I know I'm not I'm not the best shot in the department, but laughing Not the best? Lawton, you are the worst shot in the entire department. Hey, why don't you book Singh here, and I'll be in there in a moment? Whatever you say, partner. - Mm. - Come on. Oh, and just for the record, my marksmanship proficiency ratings went up by two points last month. All right? Two points. Whoo. Iris. chuckles You're Detective West. The one, the only. Yeah. Can I see you for a second, CSI Allen? - Yeah. - Yeah. Hmm. Um, what are you doing? What? I think a little office PDA between husband and wife is okay. Husband and wife? Yeah, that's what happens when you do the vows, exchange the rings. Where is your ring? Uh People should know that you are a taken man. - chuckles - watch whirring - That's so weird. - What's that? My meta-human alert app. It thinks that you're a meta-human. That is so weird. Yeah, it must be on the fritz. - chuckles - Mm, let's go. Where are we going? Home. Come on. Where do you people get off robbing Central City's Royal Bank? This town belongs to Zoom, and those of us he deems worthy enough to enforce his will. Here. Take it. Thanks a million. Or should I say two? Hmm. panting No. panting Wait, please. Don't hurt me. Hurt you? I just want to give you a kiss. giggles Now what did I tell you about watching that behind? I thought that was your job. flames roaring Good thing the only man I can kiss is the only one I want to. Just got word some breachers came through. Ooh, you know my favorite thing is to kill people from other Earths. Today's your lucky day. sighs Oh, gosh. ethereal music   This is nice. Our home. I mean, I forgot, I guess.   What is wrong with you? You've been acting weird all day. Um I'm just not myself, I guess. chuckles nervously Your mom called. solemn music   line trilling Allen residence. Hello? - Uh, hello? - Mom. Wow, you certainly took your time calling back. Yeah, um, I'm I'm sorry about that. sighs Thank you so much for the anniversary tickets to Atlantis. Your dad and I have always wanted to go. Um, I'm I'm really glad you liked them. - chuckles - Are you okay? You sound kind of strange. I'm fine. I'm I'm Hey, I know. Maybe I should give the plane tickets to you and Iris. Nice little romantic getaway. You two could get started on giving me a grandchild. chuckles No, I want you to use them. I'm really glad to hear you happy, Mom. Aw, I love you, Barry. I love you too. Okay, bye-bye, honey. line clicks off   Baby, what's wrong? Uh, nothing. It was, uh Um, it was just good to talk to my mom. We should get ready, yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. sighs Where is he? Where is he? I don't know. I can't find him anywhere. Yeah, well, he better show up soon because he's been gone for hours and we only have so many of those left before Zoom needs the speed. laughing Oh, you're talking about Barry. - Yeah. - Yeah. Don't worry about him. He'll be fine. Who'd you think I was talking about? I thought you were talking about me. - You? - Yeah, 'cause we found Barry's double, so where the hell am I? You know, I always thought in another life I was, like, I don't know, like a really wealthy, famous inventor, you know, sort of like the Earth-2 Elon Musk. Only with less RBF, obviously. Here's some advice for you. How about spending more time looking for Zoom and less time worrying about what someone who is not you is doing with their life? sighs jazz piano plays  Some things that happened   For the first time   Seem to be happening   Again   And so it seems that we have   Met before   And laughed before  Whoa.  And loved before  Joe can sing. He's the best. Right.  Who knows?   Yeah, who knows   Where or   When?    - Ooh. - patrons applauding Hey, baby. Hi. Mm, oh, yeah. Joe, hey. It's Joseph, Bartholomew. Pop, be nice. You too, babe. I'll be right back. Yeah. sighs So you're a singer. laughs So you're still an idiot. laughs Are you upset with me? Or you just you just don't like me? Have you lost your mind? Central City's going to hell in a handbasket because this lunatic Zoom is running around killing folks, and you got my daughter on the front lines. Wait wh me? It has always been about you, Bartholomew. You're the most selfish person I've ever met. And I'm a musician; we're all selfish. You wanted to get your PhD so you could further your career, and she had to become a police officer to pay your tuition. We both know that she'd be safer going back to write at the newspaper. Oh, Dad, please, stop. CCPN was an internship. All I did was get coffee for real writers. Being a cop like grandpa is what I love. You raised me to be tough, and I am. Everything's fine, and we're here to have fun, right? Right. Everything's great. How's it going? Uh, slow, which is not a good adjective when it comes to a speed cannon. Well, we got another problem. Why do we always have to have another problem? You've got to see this. Somebody call The Flash. cracking people screaming His name is Adam Fells, but he calls himself Geomancer. So this meta-human is a breacher? No, Fells died on my Earth. This must be his Earth-1 doppelganger. Well, at least now, we know his name. Might be a little easier to track him down. Yeah, but with Barry gone, how are we gonna stop him even if we do find him? Well, Jay, you could shoot yourself up with that stuff. What was it? Velocity - Velocity-6. - I cannot take V-6. But it gave you your speed back long enough to get that bullet out of Wells, saved his life. Joe, don't ask me to take Velocity-6 again. Look, Jay, I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but Barry is protecting your world, and our world needs a Flash right about now. tense music   Jay. Caitlin, I like the way you look at me with warmth and pride, and I'm not I'm not worthy of those. Yes, you are. No, I did a terrible thing, Caitlin. When my world's particle accelerator went off, I became a speedster. I became the fastest man alive, only only it wasn't enough for me. I wasn't I wasn't fast enough. So I figured with my scientific background, I could increase my powers, and I did. So you've taken Velocity-6 before? Yes. But there were some unforeseen side effects. This is why you didn't want Barry to take it or even know about it. Zoom never stole your speed. This is what's making you sick. Velocity-6 is killing you. I wasn't lying when I said that stuff was dangerous. sighs I've made so many mistakes. You have something now that you've never had before. Me. And I'm gonna figure this out. melancholy piano music playing  My funny valentine   Sweet comic valentine   You make me smile  So can we talk more about why Joseph doesn't like me? What's there to talk about? I mean, you can't stand him either. Right.

I haven't heard that name in a long time. But that is your name, isn't it? Your real name? Please, look I know you. Don't do this. If you knew me at all, you would know that I hate the name Caitlin.

So Caitlin and Ronnie's doppelgangers are evil? Those are some dope names, though. This was supposed to be a surgical mission, Allen. Find Zoom's lair. Rescue Jesse. Get in, get out, not get involved. All right, well, look, I am involved, okay? Joe's in the hospital. They nearly killed him. No, he isn't. Joe West, your Joe West, is alive and safe on your Earth, so is Caitlin, so is Iris. These people, Barry, they're mirror reflections. As far as your life is concerned, they don't exist. Killer Frost, Deathstorm, they know that you're here. Then it's not long before Zoom does too, and then my daughter's dead, and that's on you. Jesse still has time, okay? Iris and Joe need me now. I have to get back to them! She is not Iris! She is Iris! Okay, she is to me! No matter what universe I'm in, they are my family! I would think by now you should get how important family is. I'm going, Wells. I have to. clears throat Find Zoom. sighs sirens wailing I ran Adam Fells through BCI. Not exactly a model citizen before he was a meta-human.

One of my snitches gave me a lead on Killer Frost and Deathstorm's location. We're gonna bring them in. Okay, um, I'm coming with you, Iris. No. Barry, I just lost my father. I cannot lose my husband too. All right, well, Cisco's the only one that knows how to operate the device, so you have to take him. I can't put a civilian in harm's way. Look, I've seen fire, and I've seen rain. I can handle myself, okay, Mrs. West-Allen. solemn music   I love you.   I love you too. Lawton, let's move. Yeah, uh goofy chuckle We need to work on finding Jesse. Are you sure this is what you want to be doing? I am, all right? Right now, we have to help Iris. Just make sure no one else gets hurt. sighs dramatic music sighs sirens wailing   tires squealing   CCPD! It's over, Fells! No offense to you boys in blue, but I'm waiting on the man in red. You better hope The Flash doesn't show up, or you're finished. See, that's funny. I don't think he will show. I've been causing tremors for days and no sign of him. I think he's gone. What is it they say in boxing? Let's get ready to rumble. cracking and rumbling glass shattering   - What the - grunts   I heard you were looking for The Flash. Looks like the Velocity-7 is working. Now, go get him. warbling That's a new one. Is that all you have? You don't ever want to see all I have.   rapid beeping The Velocity-7's wearing off. heavy breathing You've heard what an eight on the Richter scale can do to a city. Imagine what it's gonna do to your skull. gunshots   - You hurt? - grunts My pride and my body. Pride and my body. thunder rumbles You really sure this is the place? Maybe you should stay in the car, Lawton. Look alive, gents. tense music   Hey, maybe maybe your snitch was wrong. I mean, maybe they're not even here.   watch whirring sighs No, they're here. suspenseful music   You didn't knock. How rude. Drop 'em.   Ronnie. Is Martin Stein in there? Oh, I haven't let him out in years. Doesn't talk much anymore. laughing You killed my father, you evil bitch. He shouldn't have palled around with a breacher. That's a big no-no as far as Zoom's concerned. I can't believe you two work for Zoom. No, they work for me. I work for Zoom. suspenseful music   Who the hell are you? laughs Well, that's funny. I was just gonna ask you the same thing.   - Doppel - Ganger. What the hell is going on here? Are you two related to each other? Oh, I knew there was another me here. And I knew you were coming, Cisco, even before you entered the breach and set foot on this world. See, we're all connected Francisco. My name is Vibe. Reverb. Actually not the worst name you could've come up with, but not the best. chuckles I've been watching you, Vibe, and I have to say I am extremely disappointed. Yeah, I know the feeling. I'm not sure what's worse, the fact that you're part of Zoom's gang, or that weird samurai situation you got going on on the top of your head there. Listen to this. What if Zoom wasn't running the show anymore? What do you mean? You don't even know how powerful you are. All you use your powers for are these cheap parlor tricks when you you could be a god. We could be gods. tense music   Are you Cloud City Vadering me right now? Are you out of your mind? Let's turn them over to Zoom. Speak to me like that again, and I will shatter your entire nervous system without breaking a sweat.   So, Vibe Do you want to run Central City? What do you say? suspenseful music I say Flash, save us! grunting and groaning panting Hey, that didn't hurt you, did it? - No. Why would it? - I don't know. And who the hell are you? Look, Detective, just get out of here, all right? No, not without them. dramatic music   Stay here!   Round two.   Look, mirror-mirror, I already told you I'm not going to the dark side with you. Lawton screaming gunshots You're a rotten shot.   I'm not.   Are you telling me I can do that? I can show you.   No! both grunt   Stop, both of you! Zoom wanted him alive. You know what Zoom will do if you don't obey him. gasps and grunts gasps No! That. suspenseful music What did I say you should do if you encountered a speedster? Leave him unharmed.   Does this look unharmed to you? growls gasps   gagging I'm happy to see at least one of you knows their place. - gagging - grunts   Barry! gasping whimpers No. panting No. melancholy music   sighs   - gasps - Sorry. Did I forget to say this might sting? sighs It's not my first road rash. groans I'm a speedster, remember? You made sure no one will forget that today. Thanks to you. The Velocity-7 held up pretty well. Moving on to Velocity-8. I'm gonna figure it out, I swear. I just need you to figure out how to re-stabilize the breach. Barry, Cisco, and Wells still have 24 hours to go. So we have one day, or they could be stuck there forever. ominous musical flourish   metallic tapping ominous music   tapping continues sighs   tapping continues dramatic music   Jesse. Jesse! Hey. I'm here with your dad! We're gonna get you out of here, all right? I promise. ominous music It's not wise to make promises you can't keep, Flash. Look around. This is the last place you'll ever see
My name is Barry Allen,  and I am the fastest man alive.  To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,  but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,  I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.  I hunted down the man who killed my mother,  but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats,  and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.  I am The Flash.  Previously on "The Flash"  His name is Geomancer.  I'm waiting on the man in red.  The Velocity-7's wearing off.  gun blasting  - You hurt? - Only my pride.  Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.  Daddy, please help me.  Don't let him take me, Daddy.  I told you we're a team.  Now you're a part of it.  We're gonna help you save Jesse.  We're not sending you through alone.  We're going to Earth-2.  Just remember what Jay said, okay?  Things here are all sorts of trippy.  Caitlin  If you knew me at all,  you would know that I hate the name Caitlin.  I'm Killer Frost.  Look out!  Dad!  You killed my father, you evil bitch.  You shouldn't have palled around with a breacher.  - Flash, save us! - No!  Zoom wanted him alive.  You know what Zoom will do if you don't obey him.  No!  - Argh! - indistinct shouting  Look around, Flash.  This is the last place you'll ever see.  I know you're here, Harrison Wells,  and you did not come alone.  siren wailing  You can try to hide  whooshing sound  But I'm the fastest man alive.  I will scour this city  until I hunt you down.  And when I do,  all of you will feel my wrath.  CCPN is reporting that Dr. Harrison Wells,  the infamous founder of S.T.A.R. Labs  who uncharacteristically has gone unseen  for nearly four months is now a wanted man.  These images and messages went up moments ago  throughout Central City by Zoom.  Have you seen channel 52?  You're not safe here, Dr. Wells. Zoom's looking for you.  I know what he's doing. Alert security.  Evacuate S.T.A.R. Labs.  Lock down the facility.  - What about you? - Don't worry about me, Henry.  Just get everyone out of here now.  Now! Go!  gun charging Harry!  Don't shoot!  sighs Damn it, Ramon.  gasps  Where's Allen?  - Zoom took him. - What?  We tracked down Deathstorm and Killer Frost,  met my doppelganger, Reverb  super evil guy, super evil powers.  The three of them almost took down Barry until  Zoom showed up, killed Cisco-2,  killed Deathstorm for hurting a speedster.  But then he left Killer Frost alive  and then took off with Barry.  How are you still alive?  Looks like he cares even less about me  than you do, Harry.  No, no.  Zoom doesn't do anything by accident.  Did he follow you here?  I've seen âHeatâ like 50 times, okay?  I know how to shake a tail.  He didn't follow me.  But check this out.  I jacked these from my dead ringer.  I think we can tweak these puppies  use them to find Zoom.  Damn it, Ramon, we don't have time for this.  Zoom is hunting us  Zoom is hunting us!  We need to make an alternate plan,  because if we don't, Zoom  Stop thinking like that, okay?  We're gonna find Jesse, and we're gonna find Barry.  I know we will.  Hello? Is anyone there?  Okay, whoever's responsible for this,  oh, ho, ho  boy, we're gonna have words,  the two of us, okay?  This is this is not okay.  Barry-2.   sighs Dr. Wells,  this is very disappointing.  I mean, the two of you should be ashamed of yourselves.  You can't just lock someone in a room like this.  How long was I in here for?  Barely a day.  One day?  One day?  Oh, jeez, my wife's gonna be worried sick.  - Dr. Wells. - Yeah?  Doctor, I'm not sure if you're aware of this,  but my wife is a very well-respected detective  in the Central City Police Department.  She's got to be very upset.  Whoa, this is heavy.  It certainly is.  And I'm sorry, fellas,  but I demand to know what the heck  is going on here this instant.  Barry, this is a very long story.  One that we don't have time to tell right now.  We're sorry we locked you in that room  for a day, but right now, you need to leave.  - You need to gather - alarm blaring  He's here.  indistinct shouting  Do not move.  dramatic music     whooshing sound  Ugh!  Where are Wells and his friends?     Dr. Wells, hey, what the heck is going on?  Oh, Zoom's after us.  Zoom? What do Why would Zoom be after you?  That's part of that long story  I was telling you about.  I don't know if I can  deal with something like this.  - You have a time vault? - Yeah.  I'm an enemy of Zoom, and I need a place to hide  when something like this happens.  - Get in! - Yes, sir.     That's Zoom! That's Zoom!  - wheezing - Ramon  Shut him up.     whimpering     gasps  Okay.  Breathe, breathe, breath, breath  Fake wall.  He's not gonna fall for another fake wall.  We need to move.  We need to find a different place to hide  and make a plan.  Wait, wait hey, hey, hey, hey.  No.  I think before we do anything,  you have to explain to me everything  that is going on here.  You're wasting your time.  I used to think I could escape too  when I first got here.  There's no way out.  tapping  Who is that?  I don't know.  He's been here since Zoom brought me to this place.  tapping  Stop, okay?  Just just please stop.  Jesse, I think he might be trying to help us.  Nothing is gonna help us.  That's not true.  We're gonna get out of here.  Your dad's gonna find us, I promise.  You sure have a lot of faith  in a man who only cares about himself.  sighs  You know, I actually thought that  at first too.  It's not true.  Every decision that he's made  every action he's taken since we've met  has been to save you.  Your dad hasn't given up on you, Jesse.  Don't give up on him.  whooshing noise gasps  Believe what you want,  but the only reason that you're still alive  is so I can kill you  in front of your father.  And the only reason your father's still alive  ominous music  Is to get me your speed.     Once he does that,  he will die too.  Up after the break,  earthquake-causing meta-human  leaves citizens shaken and wondering,  where is The Flash?  It's finished.  Breach stabilized again.  Barry, Cisco, and Wells have 20 hours to get back.  You're amazing.  When it comes to stabilizing breaches, maybe  not so much when it comes to fighting meta-humans.  You were a little rusty.  I was too slow.  Geomancer's still out there, Caitlin.  He has to be stopped.  I have to be ready in case he attacks again.  How much longer till the Velocity   Velocity-8 is ready?  I need to finalize the compound  make sure the extracellular matrix stays intact  so you don't lose your speed as fast.  Okay, great.  What is it?  After your last encounter with Geomancer,  I ran some tests.  The Velocity-7 is reacting  with the damaged cells in your body.  It's causing more cellular degeneration.  Well, I have faith that the next batch  won't do the same thing.  Jay, I can't keep giving this to you  if it's hurting you.  If it'll help me defeat Geomancer,  you might have to.  Till Barry gets back,  I may be the only chance this city has.  I don't know how this is possible,  but you somehow made basketball  sound more boring than baseball.  Fix this.  Scott Evans, your new editor.  - Oh, Iris - West, I know.  You wrote the story about the recent Geomancer attack.  - Yeah, I did. - I'm not running that.  What, why?  It's a fluff piece to try to make people feel good.  What they need to know is the truth;  The Flash might not always be there to save them.  You disagree?  I think that he's saved a lot of people  in this city.  But where is he now?  I need to run a real story.  Okay, uh  what if I could get you an exclusive  with the meta-human that fought Geomancer?  This this other Flash.  What, you friends with him too?  Just, um, give me a little time.  Fine, but if it's the same  as the other crap that you wrote,  I'm gonna run something about how The Flash  may not be the hero we all dreamed he was.  dramatic music     sighs     Iris Hey, Iris.  Barry, where were you last night?  whispering Oh, my God.  My father died yesterday,  and you never even came home.  I know, I know. I heard.  I'm so, so sorry.  You you heard?  You were there, Barry.  I actually was not there.  I'm I'm gonna yeah, okay.  Okay, look.  Come to my lab. Just come up to my lab.  I'm gonna explain everything, okay?  I'm gonna explain it.  So the Barry from yesterday was not you?  No.  No, look, I I know  that this is hard to believe,  but I mean, it is just like that sci-fi series,  âCommander Carl, Space Marshal of the Galaxy, â  where Carl gets sucked into a black hole  and ends up on another planet  that he thinks is Earth,  but really it's Earth  of another universe.  Have have you guys not s  oh, it's a seminal episode.  You should check it out.  So that's why you weren't wearing  your wedding ring yesterday.  Well  And and that that kiss was was so  I'm I'm sorry. He got frisky with you?  sighs  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay, I'm gonna have to find this guy  and give him a piece of my mind.  Don't give him too much.  Your husband tells us you've been tracking Zoom.  Yeah, I've been trying to. Why?  - We need to find his lair. - Lair?  He's a bad guy; I'm calling it a lair.  Zoom is looking for you.  Why are you going after him?  Zoom has my daughter  and our Barry, and we need to rescue them both.  Look, I want to find Zoom  just as much as anybody, but no one can track him.  The only person who would know where he would be hiding someone  would be a meta that's worked with him.  A meta like Killer Frost?  Yeah, maybe.  But Zoom kept her alive yesterday  because she always obeys him.  There is no way that she's gonna tell you where he is.  I'm not so sure about that.  If she loved Deathstorm as much as my Caitlin loved Ronnie,  I think she'd be more than upset at Zoom for killing him.  Look, finding her is gonna be just as hard as finding Zoom.  But if anyone can do it  My husband can.  Right, yes.  I can, actually.  Um, all right.  humming  Okay, well it looks like Patty Spivot was a CSI tech  on most of the Killer Frost cases.  She's pretty thorough, so  What's that?  Oh, this is Killer Frost meta-data  collected from numerous crime scenes  DNA trace movements, facial recognition,  temperature fluctuations specific to her.  My algorithm compiles all the data  and gives us an approximate location.  It works on most metas, except for Zoom, of course.  He's too fast never leaves a trace.  Okay.  Looks like the best bet's the woodlands.  Best CSI in Central City.  You know where that is, right?  - Yeah. - Let's go.  Wait, I'm going with you guys.  You're gonna need some help. Okay.  Iris, I  Barry, Zoom and his followers  are the reason that my father is dead.  If I can stop him from killing anyone else,  I'm gonna try.  Okay, then I'm coming too.  - No. - No.  Barry, this is not what you do.  I know that.  But I also know Joseph didn't like me too much,  but he was my father-in-law.  If you're going,  I am coming with you.  dramatic music  All right.  You can come, but you stay out of our way.  sighs  tapping  That's not Morse code.  tapping  I know he's trying to tell us something.  We just have to find the pattern.     tapping  There's no pattern, Barry.     You know, your dad, who I'm pretty sure  is one of the smartest people to live on either of our Earths,  told me the only person smarter than him  was you.  He said that?     If that's true,  we work together  I know we can figure this out.     Worth a shot?     Okay.  tapping  tapping  Well, he never goes past five.  What?  He never goes past five knocks without pausing.  Right? Listen.  tapping     Hey, you're right.     I think  I think I know what that is.  It's a five-by-five tap code used by POWs.  That would only get us to 25 letters,  and there's 26 in the alphabet.  Not if you combine C and K.  They sound the same.  Let's try it out.     - Worth a shot. - All right.  tapping  There it is.  Looks different than before.  That's because I realized that there was a flaw  with Velocity-8,  so I reformulated the extracellular matrix, and  Velocity-9.  You know what they say,  ninth time's the charm.  Hey.  Hey, Iris. You okay?  Yeah, I'm just a little worried about the time.  Well, don't worry.  They'll make it back before we close the breach.  Um, actually I was here  to talk to you about something else.  Oh. Yeah, sure.  What is it?  Well, my new editor  wants me to write a scathing article  on The Flash not being able to protect Central City  from Geomancer.  Really?  Yeah.  I was hoping to write an article about you instead  something that would calm people  until Barry got back.  You know, Iris,  I don't know if that's the best idea.  Well, I think that if people  knew that there was someone that could protect them,  it would  it would really help.  Would you just think about it?  alarm blaring  Some crazy alarm's going off.  Yeah.  Don't even think about running.  There's a new Flash in town.  You know, the one with the shiny helmet.  Not the speedster I was hoping to crack,  but let's see just how fast he is,  Central City.  suspenseful music     Give me the Velocity-9.  Jay, we have no idea how long it will last.  We don't have time to figure that out, Caitlin.     electricity crackling  shouting  crowd screaming     whooshing sound     panting  Jay?  I'm okay.  That just took a lot out of me.  panting  But it sure felt good.  laughing  That was amazing, Jay.  Thanks. I kind of surprised myself,  to be honest.  Caitlin deserves all the credit.  Looks like your Velocity-9's a winner.  I still need to run some tests.  panting  Iris, about the interview, um  I think that I have everything that I need.  Great.  'Cause I could really use a nap.  I'll, uh, be downstairs.  tapping  Two down, five across.  - It's J. - J?  That's what you're tapping the letter J?  All right, what's next?  tapping  A.  All right.  tapping  Five down  tapping  Four across.

It's not my name.  Yes, it is.  You just don't want to hear it because it reminds you  of someone you used to be.  Trust me, I know that person very well.  You don't know anything about me.  I know the Caitlin Snow on my Earth.  I know that when she loves someone,  that person is her world.  That person was Ronnie Raymond.  And he died too.  It devastated her,  and I can see it's doing the same to you.  dramatic music  Zoom took that.  His daughter my friend  he's gonna take them away from us,  just like he took Ronnie from you.     Caitlin  all you have to do is tell us where he's keeping them.  And then you'll never hear from us again,  and you can go.     Please.     Fine.  I'll show you where it is.  But that's it.  Uh, where are we going?  Ascension Cliffs.     smashing  Argh!  Gah!  Look, are you sure you want to keep doing that?  You know, if Zoom catches you,  he's gonna hurt you again.  I don't understand why I can't phase through this.  Well, your body would need to have the same resonance  as the glass walls.  I should be going more than fast enough.  It's something else. sighs  Maybe you're resonating at a different frequency.     Yeah, your Earth vibrates at a different frequency than mine.  Same reason Cisco can't vibe.  Is there any way to make up the difference?  Only if I can go faster.  panting     Wow, wow, wow.  We're going up there?  That's where Zoom's lair is.  A place only a speedster could get to.  There are like the Cliffs of Insanity.     So how do we get up there?  I can make you something to climb on, darling.  Are you serious?  You want us to  what, just climb to the top of those cliffs  on ice?  Got any better ideas?  No, ma'am, I'm just, you know, I  I've got you know, I'm wearing wingtips here.  They, um, don't have much tread.  Barry.  Barry, um, maybe you should stay behind.  -

Hey, hey, hey.  Bringing us up here wasn't part of the deal, either,  but here you are.  Something tells me you're not as cold as I thought you were.  Maybe, maybe not.  dramatic music  rumbling  chain snaps     What's going on? Why why isn't it working?  I don't know.  I've never had this problem before.  Dr. Wells  Carbyne.  It's some form of carbyne.  This cell's made out of some form of carbyne.  You'll never be able to freeze him out of there.  You can't phase out of there?     Just go, all right?  Before Zoom comes back.  We're not leaving you here.  I can't get out of this cell.  I've tried  a lot.  I'm not fast enough to phase through this.  You got  just leave, all right?     Just leave.     Do you know what we did  to get here, Barry?  We convinced her  Killer Frost  to show us the way.  Then we climbed some insanely steep cliffs  outside on footholds made of ice  ice!  And all of us risked our lives,  knowing Zoom was after us, to rescue Jesse  and you.  Now, I don't know you,  and you don't know me,  but I can tell you that today,  I I did things that I never thought possible,  because I needed to prove to my wife  and to myself that I could.  Now, if I can do the impossible today,  so can you.  sighs  I'm just Barry Allen,  but you're The Flash.     If you tell yourself  you can phase out of there,  you'll do it.  whooshing  laughing  Okay, let's go.  Go, come on. Wait, wait!  Hey, hey, hey! We're not leaving him.  Barry, there's no time.  He's not going anywhere,  and neither are any of you.  Thank you  for bringing them to me.  You double-crossed us?  He killed Ronnie!  Guess my heart is as cold as you thought after all.  I can't believe you.  Just so you know, you would be very disappointed  in you right now.  Zoom.  Let them go.  All you need is me and Barry.  You're right.  I may not be able to kill you yet,  but I can kill them.  suspenseful music  No, no! No  I told you I'd kill you in front of your father.  No! No!     No     Get out of here.     Caitlin.  You were right.  He killed Ronnie.  Thank you.     I'm not leaving without him.  Barry, there's no time.  There's no time!  - ice crackling - I can't hold him forever.  Hey, I'm coming back for you when this is over, all right?  Go!  I'm coming back!  Jay, we need to do something.  Our only chance is to reboot the electromagnetic insulators  and hope the quark matter redistributes equally.  How do we do that?  We have to do it manually.  But you can't be near the stabilizer rings  when they power on, or you'll get  sucked into the breach.  Not if I create a vortex  to counteract the pull.  You can't do both at the same time.  Cait  I have to try.  suspenseful music  I'll help you.  What? Dad, no.  Look, if it brings Barry  back to this Earth, I'm doing it.  Are you sure?  The more we talk about it, the less sure I'll be,  so let's just do it.  Okay.  There's an override switch on every stabilizer ring.  - I'll create the vortex. - Yeah.  And you flip all of them. They should all reboot.  Got it.  Once that's done, you power up the cannon.  - The breach should stabilize. - And what if it doesn't?  We're all out of luck.  machinery roaring     The Velocity-9 is running out!     alarm blaring  dramatic music  Jay!  I guess now we know how long  the Velocity-9 lasts.  - Are you okay? - Yeah.  Yeah.  I just hope they are.     I'm fine. I'm just a mess.  You need to get out of Central City, all right?  Any place you think you'll be safe from Zoom.  Yeah, we, um we have some family  in Atlantis that can help us.  Yeah, okay, good.  You may not have been struck by lightning  over here like I was,  but today, you risked your life  to save somebody you didn't even know.  That's a hero, Barry.  Thank you both.  Barry  is my father still alive on your Earth?  Yeah, he is.  Give him a hug for me, will you?  I will.     Hey.  You guys need to get someplace safe too.  Where are you going?  The only place we can.  - Dad, we can't just leave. - We have to, honey.  What, you want me to leave everything I have here?  My friends, my family  I mean, my life.  You don't have a life here anymore.  Either do I.  Zoom is too powerful.  I can't stop him.  And as long as he is here,  he's gonna hunt us down  until we're dead.  alarm blaring  Wells, if you're coming with us, we have to go.  alarm blaring  It's almost time.  I don't care what time it is.  After all we did to stabilize this breach,  we're not closing until they show up.  Y'all hear me?  dramatic music  Cisco!  Get ready to close the breach for good  Zoom's coming!     Forgetting someone, Flash?  Let him go.  Close the breach.  Tell Jesse I love her.  Tell her yourself.  Argh!  growling     It shouldn't be taking this long.     shouting  Close it! Close it now!  explosion     You did it you made it!     Barry.     gasps  screaming  No!My name is Barry Allen,  and I am the fastest man alive.  To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,  but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,  I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.  I hunted down the man who killed my mother,  but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats,  and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.  I am The Flash.  Previously, on "The Flash"   Zoom wants you dead.  Do you think he can do everything really fast?  - How you doing, Dick? - You're fast.  Welcome to my Earth-2.  Dad!  No! No! Flat line tone  Caitlin. That is your name, isn't it?  I hate the name Caitlin. I'm Killer Frost.  Ronnie and Caitlin's doppelgangers are evil?  If you're coming with us. We have to go.  dramatic music  Cisco!  Get ready to close the breach for good,  Zoom's coming.  - Yells - No!  He's not dead. He's not dead.  Caitlin  He's not dead. He's not.  - Caitlin - This isn't happening.  This isn't happening again.  Hey, I got you.  Come on.  - Open it up. - Allen  - I need to go back. - I can't do that.  - Open it up! - Allen!  The breaches are closed.  All the breaches are closed.  Why can't we just open one of 'em?  The quark matter energy that we used to seal the breaches,  it prevents them from being opened, ever again.  There's no going back to our world.  Wait.  We're trapped here for good?  Yes.  somber music     No, we can't just let Zoom get away with this.  He just murdered Jay right in front of us.  There's got to be something we can do.  There's not.  Not this time.  It's over.     No.     How's she doing?  Not good. We tried to get her to go home,  but she refused to leave, so, you know,  I just sat with her until she fell asleep.  First Ronnie, now Jay.  scoffs Yeah.  I'm afraid what this double dose of grief is gonna do to her.  I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.  She'll be fine.  Snow's strong. She'll get past this.  But in the meantime, I would not say anything to her  about her counterpart from my Earth.  That goes for Joe and Iris too.  Why?  Because you don't want to influence their reality  in ways that should not be influenced.  Like in the same way as when Barry time-travels?  Exactly, but also,  what's the point?  Those people are not your people.  Their lives are not your lives.  Never were, never will be.  Bury it. Move on.  Yes?  Yeah. That I can do.  Allen?  So that's what we did.  We didn't talk about Earth-2.  We kept what happened there between the three of us  and got on with our lives knowing  there was nothing we could do now to stop Zoom.  Instead, we tried to just adjust  to our new circumstances and cope with our losses.  Jay's death took its toll   left scars on all of us, some more than others.  And so to try and keep my mind  off thoughts of the surreal other life  I experienced that wasn't my own,  I kept running, waiting for some  other meta-human threat to rear its ugly head  and distract me from the frustration I was feeling,  and as fate would have it,  I did not have to wait long.  All good.  Hey, ugly! It's time for dinner.  I think Bruce has gone belly up.  Power down the grid.  We're gonna have to fish him out.  dramatic music     So this is where Waller kept all her secret projects, huh?  One of many sites, I'm learning.  I'm sure the new Director of A.R.G.U.S. will clean up  the mess that Waller left behind.  Easier said than done, honey.  Hey.  My wife can do anything she puts her mind to.  Code seven in Aquaria Three.  I repeat, code seven in Aquaria Three.  There's been breach in the aquarium!  You have an aquarium? Why?  What the hell?     roars     Are you kidding me?  Seven, six, five,  four, three, two, one.  - Whoa! Yes! - Time. Laughs  Ain't nobody faster than me.  Whoo.  - I don't know about that. - laughs  Earth to Barry.  It's your turn, dude.  Yeah, it's time to show this little punk  who the fastest stack attacker alive is.  One of you guys go ahead. I'm gonna pass.  You're afraid of a little competition?  No, just not in a gaming mood right now.  Okay, well, I guess that makes me champ.  Right?  Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with some friends.  All right.  - Bye. - Bye.  Maybe next time.  And I thought you were the competitive one  in the family.  I know, right? What's up, Bar?  Nothing. Just  I don't know, I don't think Wally likes me too much.  Well, we can fix that.  I mean, you been so busy running between alternate realities,  you two haven't had a chance to spend any time together.  What you want us to do together?  laughs  Get to know each other,  find something that you guys have in common.  He's part of the family now, Bar,  You're gonna have to give it a chance.  I know.  All right, well, look, I'm gonna head to bed, all right?  Mm.  - Good night. - Good night.  Something is up with him,  and I don't think it's just Jay's death.  He's been acting weird ever since he came back  from Earth-2.  Did he say anything to you about what happened over there?  No, not a thing. You?  Hmm.  Hey, so I been thinking.  You've been working around the clock.  Maybe you want to get some rest, go home.  You know, a good night's sleep wouldn't be  the worst thing in the world.  I'm fine.  Look, I get it.  You're having a hard time with what happened.  It's a lot to take so soon after  I said I'm fine.  Hey. Did you hear that?  No, what?  Caitlin just bit my head off.  She's been all business, no emotion lately.  She's been cold.  Cold? Come on, Cisco.  This could be the beginning of her becoming evil.  You're not worried about that?  I'm not worried about that.  Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.  Hm. You haven't mentioned anything  about about Earth-2, have you?  No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.  All right, well, look, I mean, it's gonna take some time  for her to heal.  We just got to be there for her, keep her busy.  That shouldn't be a problem.  Oh. Hey, Dig, Lyla.  What are you guys doing here?  We came to give you the head's up, Barry.  About what?  A meta-human who escaped from A.R.G.U.S. custody,  goes by the name King Shark.  King Shark?  You mean the half-man/half-shark that tried to kill you  months ago. I thought he was dead.  That's what A.R.G.U.S. wanted you to believe  when they snatched him up, but believe me,  this half-shark is very much alive,  and his biological imperative is telling him to do one thing.  That's kill you, Barry.  scoffs  We're gonna need a bigger Flash.  sighs  So how do you know about King Shark?  Well, as the new Director of A.R.G.U.S.,  Lyla's job is to clean up Amanda Waller's messes.  King Shark was one of the bigger and weirder ones.  And it appears under her directives,  A.R.G.U.S. had been monitoring meta-human activity  for the past two years.  Why?  Well, to see if any of those powers could be exploited.  Weaponized.  How do you know that he's coming after me?  While in our custody, he kept saying the same thing.  "Zoom wants The Flash dead"  And although he removed the tracker we had in him,  the readings we did receive show he that was  headed towards Central City.  Let him come.  Barry, this thing is a killing machine.  We just came here to warn you, man.  Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.  Nah, I can't do that, Dig.  I'm sorry, but all year, we've been sitting ducks  for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.  This is the last one.  I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.  I'm going after him first. I owe that to Jay.  Wells, he's from your Earth. What do you know about him?  Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a  get this marine biologist before my particle accelerator  changed him into King Shark, and Zoom put him under his control.  So how did you track him when he attacked Barry?  Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.  I just followed.  Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.  Can you find King Shark too?  I can try.  All right.  Okay, well, all these locations are next to a body of water.  There must only be a few hours before he needs to get  back into the water to re-oxygenate his blood.  beeps  I can take the waterfront.  Can you have your team handle the rest?  - I'll get them on it. - All right.  What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?  Maybe he could help us somehow.  Or not. Looks like he died  when the particle accelerator exploded.  What about next of kin?  He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.  She's a research scientist at Nautilus Labs,  and she studies wait for it sharks.  Maybe the two of you can go and see if she's discovered  anything in her research that could help us.  Sure.  Great.  - Hey, Digg. - Yeah?  How's that helmet treating you?  Could use some improvements.  I'll get to work on it.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,  he wants to meet up with you.  All right.  He's working on his engineering project  at our place tonight.  He would love some help from that big brain of yours.  Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,  right now is kind of a crazy time.  What? What's going on?  Remember that meta-human shark  that Patty was after and attacked me?  He's back? I thought Wells you know.  Yeah, me too, but apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him  and he escaped, and now he's heading for Central City.  I get it.  I'll tell Wally some other time.  Hey, you know what?  It's all good, I'll make it work.  Tell him tonight should be fine.  Are you sure?  - Yeah.  - Thanks, Bar.  Yeah, bye.  sighs Why?  It's been two years since your particle accelerator exploded.  Seems a little late to be asking questions  about my husband, doesn't it?  Your husband passed away from cancer, correct?  I suppose you could say that.  It only took three days for every cell in his body  to grow uncontrollably.  Whatever cancer he had, it turned him into something  not human.  Well, that's why we're here, actually.  There's a meta-human in Central City  whose body seems to be mutating  in the same way as your late husband,  but he didn't die, he became a dangerous monster.  My husband was no monster.  That's not what she was implying.  What does this have to do with me?  We've read about the research you're doing here on sharks.  Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had some encouraging results,  although still preliminary.  We need to see it.  I beg your pardon?  Your research, all of it.  What my colleague means to say is that  if you could please let us take a look at your findings,  it could help us stop this meta-human from hurting anyone.  You're with S.T.A.R. Labs. I'm just supposed to trust you?  Please, Mrs. Lamden.  This could help save lives.  I'll email you what I have.  Thank you.  - Little harsh. - I was being direct.  Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.  You've been acting differently toward me  ever since you got back from Earth-2.  What's your problem, Cisco?  Nothing.  Let's just go.  dramatic music     Grid one, negative.     Grid four, negative.  Status check, grid two.  Grid two, negative.  Anything?  No, man, nothing yet.  Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.  Let's just hope Wells is doing better than we are.  Hey, how's Felicity doing?  Well, I'm not gonna lie, Barry, it was pretty rough  there at first, but you know Felicity, she's tough.  Yeah, she's just not returning any of my calls.  She has a lot going on right now.  Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call  when this is all over.  Just want to catch this thing, man,  have everything to do with Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,  so we can just move on with our lives.  Starting to do that thing Oliver does, Barry,  carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.  Got to stop that, man, it's gonna slow you down.  Still nothing.  Status check, Grid six.  Hold on, I think we got something.  dramatic music  roaring  So much for cleaning up after Waller's messes.  We don't find King Shark soon,  someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.  We'll find him, Lyla.  All right, I searched the whole area.  He's gone.  Couldn't have gotten far.  Still, he knows we're here now.  We lost the element of surprise.  Not if Wells can figure out a way to track him.  In the meantime, we'll keep looking.  All right, I'll meet up with you guys later.  I got to go see Joe's son.  Okay, I thought our relationship was hard to follow.  See ya.  chuckles He's fast, John, get over it.  Never.  Joe thought I should have you take a look.  So, this is what I got so far for my project essay  to get into CCU's engineering program.  Turbine supercars?  Turbines? Like jet engines?  Yeah, yeah, it'd use an engine like the ones they have  in some helicopters, only it'd run on bio-diesel.  - Cool. - It's very cool.  Yeah, you're gonna want to address  the fuel economy issue here.  It is a jet, so it's gonna burn through a lot of fuel.  Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.  It'll run off of anything that burns with oxygen.  No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.  Gonna wake the neighbors  laughs For sure.  Anything else?  Um  Well, I just want to help, you know.  I'm just trying to make sure they don't have  any reason to say no.  Okay. Laughs  Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that  it looks really good.  All right, let's start over, okay?  laughs Is it  why don't we go through it all together, work it out?  Sounds good.  Cool.  clears throat  This is a complete waste of time.  We're not gonna find anything in Doctor Lamden's research  to tell us how to find King Shark.  Maybe I should take a look.  Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor  with a specialty in bio-chem.  I'm just saying maybe you could use  another set of eyes, considering.  Considering what?  Considering the way you've been acting lately.  What does that mean?  You are not yourself, Caitlin,  and it's freaking me out, 'cause you have  this icy look in your eye just like you did over there.  Over there?  You mean Earth-2?  No. Uh, no.  Um, what I meant to say was  You met my doppelganger, didn't you?  laughs What? No.  Cisco.  Look, I'm not supposed to say anything.  Why not?  Because I'm not supposed to say anything.  Francisco Ramon, if you don't start talking  Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.  She's a coldhearted ice queen named Killer Frost,  a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.  There, great.  Now Harry's gonna kill me and throw myself across the room.  Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.  Okay, I hear you, but you're acting  just like she did over there.  You're being shut off. You're being detached.  You're being cold.  Because I have to be right now.  I just watched Jay get killed right in front of my eyes,  just when I was starting to feel normal again,  just when I was beginning to love.  So if I let myself feel,  if I let all of that pain and anger out,  it's never gonna stop,  and that's not gonna help me either,  so let's just get back to this research  and figure out how to find King Shark.  Okay.  Here you are.  Yup, just like back home, always working.  I'm trying to locate this King Shark.  He's here? On this Earth?  Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom  brought him here to kill The Flash.  Looks like he's stuck here just like we are.  It looks like he is, and so I need to figure this out  before more people get hurt, Jessie, so  Probability distribution algorithm?  Partial matching strategies, yes.  Based on what?  Semantic trajectories water, Central City, The Flash.  What about mobility behaviors?  Jessie.  Look, you wanted me out of that room,  but now that I am, you don't want me here.  Just let me help, please.  Grab a marker.  sighs  Yeah.  Hardest part was amping the torque  without increasing drag.  A heavier engine would only slow things down,  but this streamlined version should optimize  both the torque and the horsepower.  Yeah, I'm just worried it's won't be enough still.  Here, let's do this  use a one-to-one transfer gearbox  to drop the output shaft of the engine,  reverse rotation and send more power  to the torque converter.  I didn't come for you to just do it for me.  I thought we were gonna work on this together.  Yeah, we are, I'm  I'm just trying to speed up the process.  Why?  What, you got somewhere better to be?  No, Wally, I'm Wally.  All right. Chuckles  Do you have a problem with me?  Who could have a problem with you?  You're Barry, right? You're perfect.  Never do anything wrong.  Always this, always that.  Wally.  I mean, take a look around you, man.  You're in every picture in this room.  You know, thanks for your help,  but I'll just take care of this myself.  roars  Where's The Flash?  I know The Flash is here.  dramatic music     I can smell him.  Everybody get out!  Come on. All right, come on.  growls  Where is he?  grunts Right here!  growls  thuds  Flash, Zoom wants you dead!  Yeah, I know.  Then you get to go home, right?  Well, guess what, man.  The breaches that Zoom used to bring you here,  they're all gone. I closed 'em, for good!  There's no more Zoom.  There's no way back to your Earth.  growling  You're gonna be locked up here for a very long time.  growls  No!  growls  panting  growling  car tires screech  You might be fast, but not as fast as I am in water!  You're not gonna catch me, Flash!  tires screeching  Okay.  You okay?  Oh, yeah, I'm good.  Think he broke a few things, but I'm good.  panting  I don't suppose my homeowner's insurance  covers a "Sharknado" attack.  I don't understand you people.  Jaws busts through your house like the Kool-Aid Man,  The Flash shows up, and y'all just act like it's no big deal.  Yeah, well, we've had a lot of weird things happen  in Central City over the past two years.  Weirder than a talking shark wearing pants?  Man, you'd be surprised.  out of breath Hey.  Hey, you guys. Everybody okay?  Yeah, yeah, we're fine.  What'd you go hide under your bed?  Wally, come on.  You know, Joe and Iris told me a lot about you,  made it out like you could walk on water, or something,  but they never mentioned anything  about you being a coward.  Okay, enough!  See you guys later.  Dad, you need to talk to him.  No. It's fine, I get it.  sighs Look, I know you guys love me,  but please stop telling Wally all this great stuff about me.  Start telling him the truth. I'm not perfect.  I make mistakes that even The Flash can't fix.  Okay.  What happened with you on Earth-2?  The truth.  sighs  I shouldn't tell you guys this, but  I met your doppelgangers.  You were the cop in the family, a good one too.  laughs  I told you I would've made a good cop.  Don't get any ideas.  What about me then?  You were a lounge singer.  Yeah, you had this amazing voice, actually,  but you didn't like me at all.  You actually blamed me for Iris becoming a cop,  said that she only became one  to help her selfish husband's career.  Wait. Scoffs  We were married?  Mm-hmm.  And we went to go see Joe perform.  And that's when everything went wrong.  Um, some metas that worked for Zoom showed up,  they were looking for me.  They knew I wasn't supposed to be there,  and they attacked,  and you got caught in the crossfire,  and you died.  I knew that it wasn't you, that none of that was this life,  but  I mean, watching it happen in front of me, living that,  it didn't feel any different, because it was all still real.  And Jay warned me not to get emotionally sucked in  when I went there,  and then that's exactly what happened.  And now Joe West on Earth-2 is dead, because I showed up.  Barry, that that's not your fault.  Yeah, it is my fault.  It's all my fault.  Zoom,  this King Shark,  Jay's death,  it's all because of me.  And then I just left an entire world  at Zoom's mercy.    Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the suburbs,  King Shark shows up at your house.  I mean, I don't even know how he found me.  It's not like I was The Flash while I was at home.  - Must be a reason. - Yeah.  Have you figured out a way to track King Shark yet?  No, I don't have enough information  to create an accurate location algorithm.  What about Dr. Lamden's research?  Anything that can help us?  I didn't think so at first,  but then I found something that I think might help us.  Sharks are predators.  In order to track their prey, they use  what's known as passive electrolocation.  Passive electrolocation?  Yes, it's how they sense the bioelectric potential  around a fish's body.  King Shark senses electricity in Barry's system.  Okay, that explains how King Shark can track Barry,  but how is that going to help us track him?  We flip it. Instead of King Shark  being the predator, we make him the prey,  and track him using active electrolocation.  We reprogram our satellite to generate  a specific electric field and then measure  any electrical distortions that correlate  with a 1-ton walking shark.  chuckles That'll help us get him.  You help me out?  Sure.  Great.  Let us know when you locate him and we'll take it from there.  Okay.  Let's get the team ready.  Diggle What exactly is that?  That, my friend, is bait.  You made a Flash lure?  It's the best I could come up with  given the time frame.  It's rigged to mimic and enhance  the electric field Barry's body generates.  King Shark takes one whiff of that,  cue the "Jaws" soundtrack.  Also stuffed it with enough tranqs  to knock him out for a month.  Should make him a lot easier to reel in.  And that container.  Strong enough to hold him once he's sedated?  It's made of promethium metal. It's impenetrable.  Meanwhile, we'll be able to keep track of King Shark  with this, and the cameras that are on the lure.  Whatever he does, we'll have eyes on him.  All right, then. Let's go fishing.  Caitlin, I don't understand why  I can't be the one playing Quint in this scenario.  I should be the one out there, not you.  I need to do this.  You know Quint dies, right?  dramatic music     Water is this monster's natural habitat.  He's gonna be a lot stronger here.  You sure about this?  This ends tonight.  bell dinging  Maybe he's not gonna fall for this  He's a shark. He'll come.  Anything, Cisco?  Uh, nope, nothing that looks like it could be him.  You programmed the satellite though, right?  Yes, Harry.  I mean, you punched in the correct parameters?  You're insulting my intelligence.  But they've been waiting for hours.  Did you punch in the correct parameters?  I know they've been out there for hours,  but you're insulting my intelligence with this, okay?  - I know. - Okay.  Hey, you set the right distortion scope, right?  Oh, for real? Okay.  You know what, we're gonna play a game here.  It's called, if you're from Earth-2,  you're gonna be quiet, okay?  Yeah.  suspenseful music     Hey, Barry, are you okay?  Ever since Zoom beat me here and on Earth-2,  I've been running away from things,  instead of towards them.  That needs to change.  We'll get you back there.  I know.  Think of this as your first step.  Or swim.  laughs  beeping  Uh, hey, guys. What is that?  The big kahuna. Guys, incoming.  He's headed for the bait!  dramatic music     Whoa.  He ate the lure!  Reel him in, all right?  Come on.     Where'd he go?  He's headed for the docks.  Go, go, go.  Get ready to fire!     roaring  Those guns won't stop me, Flash.  First I'll kill you, then I'll kill them.  Oh, yeah? Let's do this then!  Come on!  dramatic music     roaring  What is he doing?  He's electrifying the water.  electricity crackling     roaring  triumphant music     grunts Ohh.  Now we can reel him in. Panting  both laughing  Diggle Hell of a catch, Barry.  Yeah.  Let's just make sure he doesn't become "the one that got away."  Won't let that happen again.  What are you gonna do with him?  I don't know yet. But one thing's for sure,  A.R.G.U.S.'s plans to turn King Shark into a weapon  died with Amanda Waller.  I think our time would be better served  learning about how he came to be and how to cure him.  You know, you should really talk to Dr. Lamden.  She's done a lot of research,  and I think it could be helpful to you.  I'll do that. Nice to see you again.  Mm-hmm.  sighs  Well, thanks a lot, Dig.  Hey, I got to thank you, Barry.  Got Lyla get her first win, I got to watch you run on water.  It was biblical.  Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan,  I lost a lot of friends brothers.  So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.  Question yourself. Blame yourself for his death.  And that guilt, it can tear you apart, but trust me, man,  you got to get control of it,  or it'll rip you up inside.  Use this, man, let it guide you,  so it never happens again.  - All right, thanks, man. - You got it.  Say hi to everyone for me, all right?  - I will. - sniffs  cell phone vibrating  Yeah, okay. That's kind of freaky.  Yeah, yeah, see? I told you.  Hey, Oliver, what's up?  rock music playing     You're a really slow reader.  laughs  So?  I want one of these super cars.  I mean, especially if I can run it  off the bacon grease I collect? I mean  Man, Wally. I'm so impressed.  Thanks.  But Barry gave me a lot of help, so  Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea,  this is your hard work. It's all you.  Barry'd say the same thing.  Would he?  Look, Wally.  Iris and I took Barry in when he was 11,  and the reason he came to live with us  is because his mother was murdered,  and his father was wrongfully imprisoned for it.  And I have been overprotective of that kid since that day.  We gave him all the love and support he needed  to get through that tragedy  and become the man he is now.  So that that pride  you see when Iris and I are talking about him,  is because  things could have gone very differently.  But he's not perfect,  and he's not favored over you or Iris or anybody else.  So you have nothing to worry about.  He's my son  just like you are.  What are you doing with those?  I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger,  see if I can get these to work over here.  So you can catch some breachers?  inhales sharply Dear God!  Caitlin, your hands are freezing.  Caitlin. I've always hated that name.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, it's starting. You're starting to become  Killer Frost?  laughs  That ain't right.  That ain't right, that's just rude.  Who put you up to this?  Barry put you up to this, didn't he?  Oh, I should've know you two were  - Cold? - Yeah.  You deserve it for thinking  that I could ever become like her.  Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.  I may be sad, I may want to be alone for a little while,  but I promise you, Killer Frost will never exist  on this earth, okay?  Besides, you tested me.  I don't even have the meta-human gene,  so please stop worrying about me, okay?  Okay.  both chuckle  Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.  For real, though, you got to work on that circulation.  You might have Raynaud's or something.  - You know what Raynaud's is? - I'm a doctor, Cisco.  Hail, hail, the gang's all here. What's good?  sighs Uh  I need to apologize to you all.  Um  Last year I made a choice  to go back in time and save my mother,  and that choice had a lot of consequences  that will haunt me for the rest of my life,  just like I know it haunts all of you too.  Zoom, Jay's death  It's all because of me,  but I own those choices.  We're the ones who opened the door to Earth-2.  We're the ones who brought Zoom here,  but we are also the ones who are gonna stop him.  How?  How are we gonna stop Zoom, Allen?  I don't know yet.  But those breaches aren't closed forever,  and we're not done with Earth-2.  Jay's death was not in vain.  We will meet Zoom again,  and the next time, I will beat him,  whoever that monster is.  ominous music     breathing heavily  dramatic music     Well, this is a complication.
